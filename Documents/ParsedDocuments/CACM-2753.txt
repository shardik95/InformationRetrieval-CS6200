a heuristic problem solving design systemfor equipment or furniture layoutsthe designer problem solver dps demonstratesthat the computer can perform simple design tasks in particular it designs furniture and equipmentlayouts this task was chosen because it is simple well defined and characteristic of many designtasks in architecture engineering urban planning and natural resource management these space planningtasks usually involve manipulating two-dimensional representations of objects to create feasible or optimalsolutions for problems involving topological and metric spatial constraints the paper describesextensive tests performed on the program dps is a heuristic problem solver with a planning phase prefixedto it it uses the planning process to give it a sense of direction diagnostic procedures to locatedifficulties and remedial actions to recover from difficulties it uses a convex polygon representationto accurately describe the objects and the layout this representation allows topological andmetric constraints to be tested and the design to be easily updated dps has been applied to 50 problems while it is slow and limited in scope the ideas behind it are general it demonstrates the needfor selectivity in controlling search and the methods used to achieve it task-specific information,planning diagnostic procedures remedial actions and selective alternative generators.cacm may 1975pfefferkorn c e.artificial intelligence computer-aided design,design synthesis diagnostic search heuristics planning problem solving representations search strategies,space planning spatial representations3.20 3.25 3.64 3.66ca750514 jb january 9 1978 2:10 pm1531 4 27532707 4 27532753 4 27531185 5 27532753 5 27532753 5 27532753 5 2753
