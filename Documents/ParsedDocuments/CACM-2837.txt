new upper bounds for selectionthe worst-case minimum number of comparisonscomplexity vi(n of the i-th selection problem is considered a new upper bound for vi(n improves thebound given by the standard hadian-sobel algorithm by a generalization of the kirkpatrick-hadian-sobelalgorithm and extends kirkpatrick's method to a much wider range of application this generalizationcompares favorably with a recent algorithm by hyafil.cacm september 1976yap c k.selection problem algorithms comparison problems,concrete computational complexity upper bounds worst-case analysis5.25 5.31ca760902 jb january 4 1978 9:48 am2837 4 28372837 4 28373150 4 28372784 5 28372837 5 28372837 5 28372837 5 28372842 5 2837
