the intrinsically exponential complexity ofthe circularity problem for attribute grammarsattribute grammars are an extension of context-freegrammars devised by knuth as a mechanism for including the semantics of a context-free languagewith the syntax of the language the circularity problem for a grammar is to determine whether the semanticsfor all possible sentences programs in fact will be well defined it is proved that this problemis in general computationally intractable specifically it is shown that any deterministic algorithmwhich solves the problem must for infinitely many cases use an exponential amount of timen improvedversion of knuth's circularity testing algorithm is also given which actually solves the problem within exponential time.cacm december 1975jazayeri m.ogden w f.rounds w c.attribute grammars circularity problem context-freegrammars computational complexity exponential time semantics4.12 5.25ca751204 jb january 5 1978 4:38 pm2703 4 27032703 5 27032703 5 27032703 5 27032886 5 2703
