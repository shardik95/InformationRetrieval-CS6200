an axiomatic basis for computer programmingin this paper an attempt is made to explorethe logical foundations of computer programming by use of techniques which were first applied in thestudy of geometry and have later been extended to other branches of mathematics this involves the elucidationof sets of axioms and rules of inference which can be used in proofs of the properties of computerprograms examples are given of such axioms and rules and a formal proof of a simple theorem isdisplayed finally it is argued that important advantages both theoretical and practical mayfollow from a pursuance of these topics.cacm october 1969hoare c a r.axiomatic method theory of programming proofs ofprograms formal language definition programming language design machine-independent programming program documentation4.0 4.21 4.22 5.20 5.21 5.23 5.24ca691012 jb february 15 1978 1:48 pm1834 5 18341834 5 18341834 5 18342021 5 18342222 5 18342227 5 18342315 5 18342326 5 18342470 5 18342732 5 18342865 5 18342896 5 18342943 5 18343014 5 18343068 5 18343077 5 18343143 5 1834196 6 1834970 6 18341303 6 18341303 6 18341323 6 18341348 6 18341469 6 18341800 6 18341818 6 1834210 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341834 6 18341987 6 1834307 6 18342042 6 18342060 6 18342192 6 18342227 6 18342264 6 18342457 6 18342597 6 18342723 6 18342732 6 18342869 6 18342981 6 18343186 6 1834728 6 1834
