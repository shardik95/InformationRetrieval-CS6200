proof techniques for hierarchically structured programsa method for describing and structuring programsthat simplifies proofs of their correctness is presented the method formally represents a programin terms of levels of abstraction each level of which can be described by a self-contained nonproceduralspecification the proofs like the programs are structured by levels although only manual proofsare described in the paper the method is also applicable to semi-automatic and automatic proofs preliminaryresults are encouraging indicating that the method can be applied to large programs such as operating systems.cacm april 1977robinson l.levitt k n.hierarchical structure program verification structuredprogramming formal specification abstraction and programming methodology4.0 4.29 4.9 5.24ca770410 jb december 29 1977 4:53 am2042 4 29722222 4 29722319 4 29722356 4 29722480 4 29722594 4 29722679 4 29722709 4 29722844 4 29722865 4 29722866 4 29722896 4 29722898 4 29722939 4 29722972 4 29722972 4 29722972 4 29722972 4 29722972 4 29723037 4 29723039 4 29723043 4 29723043 4 29723073 4 29723128 4 29723144 4 29723155 4 2972970 5 29722204 5 29722597 5 29722732 5 29722738 5 29722972 5 29722972 5 29722972 5 29723030 5 29722247 6 29722356 6 29722457 6 29722651 6 29722958 6 29722972 6 2972
