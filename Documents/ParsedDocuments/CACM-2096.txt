experiments with the m  n tree-searching programthe m  n procedure is an improvement to the mini-maxbacking-up procedure widely used in computer program for game-playingand other purposes it is based on the principle that it isdesirable to have many options when making decisions in the face ofuncertainty the mini-max procedure assigns to a max min nodethe value of the highest lowest valued successor to that node the m  n procedure assigns to a max min node some function ofthe m n highest lowest valued successors an m  n procedure waswritten in lisp to play the game of kalah and it was demonstrated that the m  n procedure is significantly superior to the mini-maxprocedure the statistical significance of important conclusions is given since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field these experiments can perhaps serve as a model for future work.cacm march 1970slagle j r.dixon j k.artificial intelligence heuristic program tree searching,lisp kalah game playing decision theory mini-max backing-up procedure backing-up procedures3.60 3.64 3.66ca700302 jb february 14 1978 8:34 am1515 4 20962096 4 20962127 4 20962210 4 20961155 5 20962096 5 20962096 5 20962096 5 20962215 5 20962096 6 2096
