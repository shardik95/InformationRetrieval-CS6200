cubic spline solutions to fourth-order boundary value problemsthe cubic spline approximation to the fourth-orderdifferential equation y'p(x)y'q(x)y'r(x)y=t(x is shown to reduce to the solution of a five-term recurrencerelationship for some special cases the approximation is shown to be simply related to a finitedifference representation with a local truncation error of order y/720)delta^8.cacm june 1973hoskins w d.cubic spline differential equations boundary value problem5.13 5.17ca730613 jb january 23 1978 1:44 pm2487 5 24872487 5 24872487 5 2487
