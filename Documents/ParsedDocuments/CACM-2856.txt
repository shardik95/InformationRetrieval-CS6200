the synthetic approach to decision table conversionprevious approaches to the problem of automaticallyconverting decision tables to computer programs have been based on decomposition at anystage one condition is selected for testing and two smaller problems decision tables with one lesscondition are created an optimal program with respect to average execution time or storage space forexample is located only through implicit enumeration of all possible decision trees using a technique suchas branch-and-bound the new approach described in this paper uses dynamic programming to synthesizean optimal decision tree from which a program can be created using this approach the efficiency of creatingan optimal program is increased substantially permitting generation of optimal programs for decisiontables with as many as ten to twelve conditions.cacm june 1976schumacher h.sevcik k c.decision tables decision trees dynamic programming optimal programs3.50 4.12 5.30 8.3ca760606 jb january 4 1978 1:50 pm1354 4 28561354 4 28561488 4 28561684 4 28562053 4 28562053 4 28562053 4 28562220 4 28562220 4 28562220 4 28562221 4 28562273 4 28562273 4 28562273 4 28562273 4 28562273 4 28562453 4 28562453 4 28562453 4 28562453 4 28562517 4 28562598 4 28562598 4 28562598 4 28562726 4 28562726 4 28562726 4 28562726 4 28562845 4 28562856 4 28562856 4 28562856 4 28562856 4 28562856 4 28562856 4 28562856 4 28563034 4 28563113 4 28563113 4 28561172 5 28561327 5 28561354 5 28562053 5 28562220 5 28562453 5 28562598 5 28562856 5 28562856 5 28562856 5 28563033 5 28563113 5 28561354 6 28562263 6 28562598 6 28562691 6 28562856 6 28562856 6 2856
