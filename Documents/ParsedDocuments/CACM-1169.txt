an algorithm for minimizing backboard wiring functionsa partially exhaustive algorithm is presentedfor solving the following problem arising from automatic layout of a computer given an ordered sete1 e2 en of n computer components for each permutation of the elements e1 e2 en there is attacheda value of an integer function f the algorithm finds a local minimum of f by evaluating the set deltaf of the increments corresponding to a certain set of exchanges of two elementshen the exchangecorresponding to the least negative increment of delta f is performed the process is iterated and stoppedwhen the set of the increments is a positive or empty set which it is proved corresponds to aminimum the procedure is similar to the downhill method for finding the minimum of a real function f(p)and can be applied to other placement problems experimental results are presented with backboards formedby many elements and different initial placements.cacm november 1965pomentale t.ca651112 jb march 6 1978 4:35 pm1169 5 11691169 5 11691169 5 1169
