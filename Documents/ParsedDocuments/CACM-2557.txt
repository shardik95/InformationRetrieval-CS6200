on the time required for a sequence of matrix productsthis paper discusses the multiplication of conformablesequences of row vectors column vectors and square matrices the minimum time required to evaluatesuch products on ordinary serial computers as well as parallel computers is discussed algorithmsare presented which properly parse such matrix sequences subject to the constraints of the machine organization.cacm january 1973muraoka y.kuck d j.matrix expressions matrix multiplication operationminimization parallel machine time minimization4.22 5.14ca730104 jb january 24 1978 4:41 pm1614 4 25572253 4 25572557 4 25572557 5 25572557 5 25572557 5 2557437 5 25573075 5 25573085 5 25572289 6 25572557 6 25572557 6 25572664 6 25572714 6 2557
