numerical solution of a thin plate heat transfer problemthe numerical solution of a system of linearequations resulting from a discrete approximation to a thin plate heat transfer problem is considered the slow convergence of point iterative methods is analyzed and shown to be caused by one of the boundaryconditions the difficulty may be removed by a standard line iterative technique.cacm september 1968stewart iii g.lick d w.heat transfer problem poisson equation boundaryvalue problem thin domain successive overrelaxation sor block sor3.20 5.17ca680909 jb february 21 1978 4:48 pm1692 5 16921692 5 16921692 5 1692
