an application of formaca nonlinear circuit analysis problem is statedand the way in which it was solved using formac is indicated the solution of the problem using formacwas notable since several other methods that were tried failed the problem is straightforward althoughuntenable by hand but nevertheless involved an elaborate use of the formac language the programwas fairly large and utilized practically every command in particular it made extensive use of thepart command several tricks were necessary in order to circumvent some of the shortcomings of theformac system this paper is more concerned with the use of programming techniques in formac than withthe actual engineering problem although readers may be interested in the problem because it is statedin a general mathematical sense and could be of interest in areas other than circuit analysis.cacm march 1967neidleman l d.ca670306 jb february 28 1978 1:27 pm1623 5 16231623 5 16231623 5 1623
