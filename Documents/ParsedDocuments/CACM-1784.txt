practical error coefficients for estimatingquadrature errors for analytic functionsall published error coefficients for estimatingquadrature errors for analytic functions were computed on the assumption that the quadrature rulewas exact for polynomials up to a given degree since these rules use rounded values for the abscissas andweights and since the true values of the integrals of some of the polynomials in question have an infinitebinary expression the quadrature rule is not exact hence these errors must be taken into considerationin computing practical error coefficients.cacm january 1968rabinowitz p.numerical integration quadrature truncationerror theoretical error coefficients practical error coefficients integration analytical functions roundoff error5.11 5.16ca680110 jb february 23 1978 2:22 pm1672 5 17841784 5 17841784 5 17841784 5 17841784 6 1784
