an interference matching technique for inducing abstractionsa method for inducing knowledge by abstractionfrom a sequence of training examples is described the proposed method interference matching induces abstractionsby finding relational properties common to two or more exemplars three tasks solved by a programthat uses an interference-matching algorithm are presented several problems concerning the descriptionof the training examples and the adequacy of interference matching are discussed and directionsfor future research are considered.cacm may 1978hayes-roth f.mcdermott j.rule induction knowledge acquisition partialmatching interference graph matching learning induction knowledge representation informal retrieval,abstraction generalization language learning complexity predicate discovery.3.36 3.61 3.62 3.66 3.70 5.32ca780507 dh february 26 1979 1:26 pm3100 5 31003100 5 31003100 5 3100
