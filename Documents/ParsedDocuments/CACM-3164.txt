progressive acyclic digraphs-a tool for database integritya progressive acyclic digraph pad algorithm accepts are requests andmaintains a graph in an acyclic state when a request creates a cycle,nodes are detached until the new are can be entered acyclicallythis process is important in certain areas of database implementationin which there are constraints on the permissible sequencesof actions two pad algorithms are presented one uses a simplepath matrix representation and the other uses a list with an"artificial gradient experiments suggest that for large n the secondis considerably faster though both are asymptotically o(nr)where n is the number of nodes and r is the expected numberof nodes reachable along paths from any given node.cacm september 1979hansen w.list processing data structures topological sort,acyclic digraph database integrity network deadlock4.34 5.32 4.33ca790905 db january 14 1980 11:56 am3164 4 31641712 5 31643164 5 31643164 5 31643164 5 3164
