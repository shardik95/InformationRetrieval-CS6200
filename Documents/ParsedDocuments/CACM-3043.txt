distributed processes a concurrent programming concepta language concept for concurrent processeswithout common variables is introduced these processes communicate and synchronize by means of procedurecalls and guarded regions this concept is proposed for real-time applications controlled bymicrocomputer networks with distributed storage the paper gives several examples of distributed processesand shows that they include procedures coroutines classes monitors processes semaphores buffers pathexpressions and input/output as special cases.cacm november 1978hansen p.concurrent programming distributed processes,microprocessor networks nondeterminism guarded regions programming languages process communicationand scheduling sorting arrays coroutines classes monitors processes semaphores buffers path expressions input/output 3.8 4.2 4.22 4.32 5.24ca781108 dh january 26 1979 10:40 am2865 4 30432866 4 30432896 4 30432898 4 30432972 4 30432972 4 30433037 4 30433039 4 30433043 4 30433043 4 30433073 4 30433128 4 30433144 4 30432597 5 30432732 5 30433043 5 30433043 5 30433043 5 3043
