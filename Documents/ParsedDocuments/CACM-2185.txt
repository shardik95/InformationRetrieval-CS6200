a note on compiling fixed point binary multiplicationsan algorithm is developed for compiling asa sequence of shifts additions,and subtractions many fixed point binary multiplications involving aconstant the most significant characteristics of the algorithm are the simplicity of the test whichdetermines if the algorithm should be applied and the degree to which it suggests efficient object code.cacm june 1971glaswin h t.compiling multiplications fixed point arithmetic4.12ca710605 jb february 3 1978 10:04 am2185 5 21852185 5 21852185 5 21852296 5 21852952 5 2185142 6 2185162 6 2185163 6 2185192 6 21852185 6 21852185 6 21852727 6 2185
