a unifying computational method for theanalysis of complete factorial experimentsa computational method which may be used forthe calculation of sums of squares in the analysis of variance of complete factorial experiments and inthe computation of main effect or interaction means is described the method is elucidated as unifying sinceone method can be used for a variety of purposes each previously requiring different methods the programmingadvantages of such a method are obvious the following variants are discussed 1 the standardanalysis of variance 2 analyses omitting certain levels of one or more factors 3 separate analysesfor some levels of a factor or for combinations of levels of more than one factor these are performedsimultaneously 4 the calculation of main effect or interaction means the mean expects the data in standardorder and it leaves the data in that order so that many analyses of the same data can be performedwithout rearrangement the total sum of squares excluding a replication sum of squares is partitionedinto all polynomial partitions and their interactions each with one degree of freedom this is so evenif factors have unequally spaced factor levels.cacm january 1967cooper b e.ca670105 jb february 28 1978 4:49 pm1650 5 16501650 5 16501650 5 1650
