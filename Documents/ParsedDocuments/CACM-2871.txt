logical analysis of programsmost present systems for verification of computerprograms are incomplete in that intermediate inductive assertions must be provided manually by theuser termination is not proven and incorrect programs are not treated as a unified solution tothese problems this paper suggests conducting a logical analysis of programs by using invariants whichexpress what is actually occurring in the program the first part of the paper is devoted to techniquesfor the automatic generation of invariants the second part provides criteria for using the invariantsto check simultaneously for correctness including termination or incorrectness a third part examinesthe implications of the approach for the automatic diagnosis and correction of logical errors.cacm april 1976katz s.manna z.logical analysis invariants program verification,correctness incorrectness termination automatic debugging3.66 4.42 5.24ca760405 jb january 4 1978 4:15 pm2871 5 28712871 5 28712871 5 28712874 5 28711682 6 28712227 6 28712317 6 28712683 6 28712871 6 2871521 6 2871
