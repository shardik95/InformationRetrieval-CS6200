cellular arrays for the solution of graph problemsa cellular array is a two-dimensional checkerboardtype interconnection of identical modules or cells where each cell contains a few bits ofmemory and a small amount of combinational logic and communicates mainly with its immediate neighborsin the array the chief computational advantage offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speedachieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel processing in this paper it is shown that cellulararrays are inherently well suited for the solution of many graph problems for example the adjacencymatrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,and typical row and column operations are readily implemented by simple cell logic a major challengein the effective use of cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithmsthat exploit the possibilities for parallelism especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherentlyserial in particular several parallelized algorithms are presented for the solution of certainspanning tree distance and path problems with direct applications to wire routing pert chart analysis,and the analysis of many types of networks these algorithms exhibit a computation time that inmany cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n where n is the number of nodes in the graph straightforwardcellular implementations of the well-known serial algorithms for these problems require about nsteps and noncellular implementations require from n^2 to n^3 steps.cacm september 1972levitt k n.kautz w h.graph theory cellular logic-in-memory arrays,parallel processing special purpose computers algorithms for distance and spanning tree problems5.32 6.22 6.5ca720901 jb january 30 1978 9:16 am2289 5 22892289 5 22892289 5 22893075 5 22893156 5 22892289 6 22892289 6 22892557 6 22892664 6 22892714 6 22892973 6 22893075 6 2289
