design and implementation of a diagnostic compiler for pl/ipl/c is a compiler for a dialect for pl/i thedesign objective was to provide a maximum degree of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment for the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler the most remarkablecharacteristic of pl/c is its perseverance-it completes translation of every program submitted andcontinues execution until a user-established error limit is reached this requires that the compiler repairerrors encountered during both translation and execution and the design of pl/c is dominated bythis consideration pl/c also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing to accommodate these extensions to pl/i without abandoning compatibility with ibm compiler pl/c permits"pseudo comments"constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source test or comment in spite of the diagnostic effort pl/c is a fast and efficient processor it effectively demonstratesthat compilers can provide better diagnostic assistance than is customarily offered even when a sophisticatedsource language is employed and that this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.cacm march 1973conway r w.wilcox t r.compilers debugging pl/i programming languages1.5 4.12 4.42ca730305 jb january 24 1978 10:45 am1179 4 25341288 4 25341323 4 25341358 4 25341380 4 25341544 4 25341646 4 25341665 4 25341781 4 25341781 4 25341787 4 25341989 4 25342111 4 25342112 4 25342182 4 25342251 4 25342497 4 25342534 4 25342534 4 25342534 4 25342534 4 25342534 4 25342534 4 25342534 4 25342541 4 25342543 4 25342556 4 25342556 4 25342559 4 25342650 4 25342650 4 25342698 4 25342708 4 25342708 4 25342733 4 25342770 4 25342820 4 25342887 4 25343053 4 25343073 4 25343083 4 25343155 4 25341787 5 25341959 5 25341973 5 25342111 5 25342182 5 25342534 5 25342534 5 25342534 5 25342708 5 25342820 5 25342971 5 25343045 5 2534799 5 2534830 5 25341477 6 25341477 6 25341491 6 25341491 6 25341787 6 25341835 6 25341974 6 25342111 6 25342534 6 25342534 6 25342534 6 25342534 6 25342556 6 2534680 6 2534799 6 2534
