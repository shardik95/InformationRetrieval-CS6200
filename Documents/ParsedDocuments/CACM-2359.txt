an improved index sequential access method using hashed overflowthe index sequential access method isam isone of the most important file management systems used with moveable head disk devices this study investigatesthe use of an unconventional method of treating overflow records the method is to use hashingtechniques to allocate space for such records if certain conditions are satisfied this is superiorto the conventional isam method of chaining the overflow records via linked list techniques these conditions are:long overflow chains with significant overflow lack of tight disk space constraints recordkeys which are small compared to the total record size and significant use of the file in the index as opposedto the sequential mode using hashed overflow the time to locate a record is dependent not on the totalvolume of overflow records as in conventional isam but on the percentage use of space dedicated to overflow records.cacm may 1972mullin j k.isam index sequential hashing scatterstorage disk cylinder overflow3.72 3.73 3.74ca720501 jb january 31 1978 12:29 pm1676 4 23591682 4 23591728 4 23591860 4 23591973 4 23592018 4 23592032 4 23592033 4 23592107 4 23592109 4 23592203 4 23592251 4 23592258 4 23592319 4 23592313 4 23592359 4 23592359 4 23592437 4 23592524 4 23592543 4 23592552 4 23592552 4 23592559 4 23592781 4 23592860 4 23592991 4 23592991 4 23593053 4 23591785 5 23592203 5 23592359 5 23592359 5 23592359 5 2359
