effective information retrieval using term accuracythe performance of information retrieval systemscan be evaluated in a number of different ways much of the published evaluation work is basedon measuring the retrieval performance of an average user query unfortunately formal proofs are difficultto construct for the average case in the present study retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing theperformance of a specific user query the concept of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probabilityof occurrence of a query term in the documents relevant to that query by relating term accuracyto the frequency of occurrence of the term in the documents of a collection it is possible to give formalproofs of the effectiveness with respect to a given user query of a number of automatic indexing systemsthat have been used successfully in experimental situations among these are inverse document frequencyweighting thesaurus construction and phrase generation.cacm march 1977yu c t.salton g.information retrieval automatic indexing contentanalysis term accuracy frequency weighting thesaurus and phrase transformations3.71 3.72 3.75ca770302 jb december 30 1977 1:52 am2990 5 29902990 5 29902990 5 29903134 5 29901976 6 29902160 6 29902524 6 29902990 6 2990
