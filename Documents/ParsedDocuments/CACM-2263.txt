the conversion of limited-entry decision tablesto optimal and near-optimal flowcharts two new algorithmstwo new algorithms for deriving optimal andnear-optimal flowcharts from limited entry decision tables are presented both take into account rule frequenciesand the time needed to test conditions one of the algorithms called the optimum-finding algorithm,leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes execution time for a decision table in which simple rulesare already contracted to complex rules the other one called the optimum-approaching algorithm requiresmany fewer calculations but does not necessarily produce the optimum flowchart the algorithms are firstderived for treating decision tables not containing an else-rule but the optimum-approaching algorithmis shown to be equally valid for tables including such a rule both algorithms are compared with existingones and are applied to a somewhat large decision table derived from a real case from this comparison twoconclusions are drawn 1 the optimum-approaching algorithm will usually lead to better results than comparableexisting ones and will not require more but usually less computation time.2 in general thegreater computation effort needed for applying the optimum-finding algorithm will not be justifiedby the small reduction in execution time obtained.cacm november 1972verhelst m.decision table flowcharting preprocessor optimal programs search3.50 3.59 4.19 4.29 4.49 5.31ca721106 jb january 27 1978 2:10 pm2263 5 22632263 5 22632263 5 22632598 5 22632691 5 22632726 5 22633113 5 22631172 6 22631172 6 22631327 6 22631354 6 22631354 6 22631488 6 22631489 6 22631548 6 22631548 6 22632220 6 22632220 6 22632221 6 22632263 6 22632263 6 22632263 6 22632263 6 22632453 6 22632598 6 22632691 6 22632691 6 22632856 6 2263
