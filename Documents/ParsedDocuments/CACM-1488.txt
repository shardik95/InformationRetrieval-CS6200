programming decision tables in fortran cobol or algola simple broad-based approach for programmingdecision tables in fortran or cobol is developed and presented with inputs in standard form as definedin the paper the programming of any decision table can be done with one or two fortran statements,or with two cobol statements if the compute verb is available in the cobol processor it is shownthat the method is applicable even when there are more than two mutually exclusive states of one two ormore table conditions it is further shown that multi-state conditions in decision tables can oftensimplify the programming the method outlined has the further advantage that all possible combinationsof conditions are considered it is shown that the suggested procedure is easily implemented in algol.cacm january 1966veinott c g.ca660107 jb march 3 1978 4:08 pm1354 4 14881354 4 14881488 4 14881488 4 14881994 4 14882053 4 14882053 4 14882220 4 14882220 4 14882273 4 14882273 4 14882726 4 14882856 4 14881237 5 14881327 5 14881488 5 14881488 5 14881488 5 14881548 5 14882726 5 14881172 6 14881327 6 14881354 6 14881488 6 14881488 6 14881489 6 14881489 6 14881548 6 14882220 6 14882221 6 14882263 6 1488
