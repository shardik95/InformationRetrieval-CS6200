optimal space allocation on disk storage deviceswhen the amount of space required for file storageexceeds the amount which can be kept on-line decisions must be made as to which files are to be permanentlyresident and which mountable these decisions will affect the number of mount requests issued to theoperators this is often a bottleneck in a computing facility and reducing the number of mounts thus decreasesturnaround time an optimization model for the assignment of files to disk packs and packs to eitherresident or nonresident status is presented heuristics are suggested for those cases in whichit is inefficient to compute the actual optimum.cacm march 1974morgan h l.disk analysis disk optimization disk files,filesystems file scheduling space allocation memory hierarchy3.72 3.73 4.39ca740303 jb january 18 1978 12:32 pm2680 5 26802680 5 26802680 5 2680
