on-the-fly garbage collection an exercise in cooperationas an example of cooperation between sequentialprocesses with very little mutual interference despite frequent manipulations of a large shared dataspace a technique is developed which allows nearly all of the activity needed for garbage detection and collectionto be performed by an additional processor operating con-currently with the processor devoted to thecomputation proper exclusion and synchronization constraints have been kept as weak as could be achieved;the severe complexities engendered by doing so are illustrated cacm november 1978dijkstra e.lamport l.martin a.scholten c.steffens e.multiprocessing fine-grained interleaving cooperationbetween sequential processes with minimized mutual exclusion program correctness for multiprogrammingtasks garbage collection 4.32 4.34 4.35 4.39 5.24ca781112 dh january 22 1979 3:24 pm2838 4 30392896 4 30392896 4 30392972 4 30393037 4 30393039 4 30393039 4 30393039 4 30393043 4 30393073 4 30393074 4 30393112 4 30392723 5 30392732 5 30392896 5 30393039 5 30393039 5 30393039 5 3039
