aparel-a parse-request languageaparel is described this language is an extensionto an algorithmic language pl/i that provides the pattern-matching capabilities normally found onlyin special purpose languages such as snobol4 and tmg this capability is provided through parse-requestsstated in a bnf-like format these parse-requests form their own programming language with special sequencingrules upon successfully completing a parse-request an associated piece of pl/i code is executed thiscode has available for use as normal pl/i strings the various pieces at all levels of the parse italso has available as normal pl/i variables theinformation concerning which of the various alternativeswere successful convenient facilities for multiple input-output streams the initiation of sequencesof parse-requests as a subroutine and parse-time semantic checks are also included aparel has proven convenient in building a powerful syntax and function macro system an algebraic language preprocessor debuggingsystem an on-line command parser a translator for dataless programming and as a general string manipulator.cacm november 1969balzer r m.farber d j.text processing string processing symbol manipulation,pl/i bnf syntax parser translator pattern matching4.12 4.13 4.20 4.22 4.29ca691106 jb february 15 1978 12:44 pm1046 4 18241105 4 18241139 4 18241140 4 18241234 4 18241263 4 18241265 4 18241496 4 18241541 4 18241565 4 18241665 4 18241693 4 18241768 4 18241781 4 18241781 4 18241781 4 18241787 4 18241824 4 18241824 4 18241824 4 18241824 4 18241825 4 18241836 4 18241861 4 18241861 4 18242015 4 18242110 4 18242126 4 18242126 4 18242127 4 18242187 4 18242252 4 18242317 4 18242545 4 18242546 4 1824464 4 18242698 4 18242733 4 1824584 4 1824631 4 1824653 4 1824680 4 1824763 4 1824795 4 1824799 4 1824945 4 18241358 5 18241614 5 18241781 5 18241824 5 18241824 5 18241824 5 1824404 5 1824
