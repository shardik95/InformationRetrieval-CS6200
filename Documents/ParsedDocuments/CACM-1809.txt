numerical analysis in a ph computer science programnumerical analysis is the study of methods andprocedures used to obtain approximate solutions to mathematical problems much of the emphasis is on scientificcalculation the difficulties of education in such a broad area center around the question of backgroundand emphasis the numerical analysis program in the computer science department should emphasize anawareness of the problems of computer implementation and experimental procedures nevertheless there is aneed for a solid background in applied mathematics.cacm december 1969parter s v.ph program numerical analysis course separation education1.52ca691203 jb february 15 1978 4:25 pm1809 5 18091809 5 18091809 5 1809
