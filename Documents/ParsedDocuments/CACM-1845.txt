loader standardization for overlay programsthe overlay capability is described for fourof the third generation computer systems cdc-6000 ge-635 ibm-360 and univac-1108 a critique of thefirst three systems is based on actual experience with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program;a short history and description of this program is presented a standardization of minimum capabilitiesfor loaders is recommended so that programs which must operate under more than one computer systemmay be easily converted and maintained a proposal that overlay software incorporates a memory occupationspecification concept instead of the conditional tree structure is delineated this concept providesmore efficient and cost-effective utilization of the memory as well as increased flexibility in program structure.cacm october 1969lanzano b c.loader overlay partition region segmentation,linkage linkage editor standardization memory utilization memory occupation tree structure,cdc-6000 ge-635 ibm-360 univac-11084.10 4.12 4.19 4.40ca691001 jb february 15 1978 4:09 pm1845 4 18451900 4 18452083 4 18452154 4 18452270 4 18452693 4 1845988 5 18451845 5 18451845 5 18451845 5 18452343 5 18451173 6 18451774 6 18451845 6 1845
