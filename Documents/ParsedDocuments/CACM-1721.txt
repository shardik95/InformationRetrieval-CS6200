determination of the intersection points of twoplane curves by means of differential equationsa new method is proposed to calculate the intersectionpoints of two plane curves the theory of singular points off a system of two differential equationsis used in developing the method the intersection point to be determined is identified with such a singularpoint and appropriate modifications are applied to the system to ensure that the singular point be stable,i.e all integrals which start in the neighborhood of the singular point will always approach this pointif the integral parameter tends to infinity in addition a method is described for systematically searchingfor all intersection points in a prescribed rectangular area.cacm july 1968kuiken h k.plane curves intersection points intersectionsplane curves integration differential equations matrix iteration singular points nonlinear differentialequations eigenvalues complex roots roots stationary points runge kutta stable singularity unstable singularity2.0 3.10 3.20 3.50 5.10ca680708 jb february 22 1978 11:51 am1721 5 17211721 5 17211721 5 1721
