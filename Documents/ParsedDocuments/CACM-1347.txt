general time-varying systems error sensitivities programthe evaluation by the propagation of variancetechnique of the sensitivity of time-varying systems to initial condition and parameter errors involvesthe determination of several system-dependent partial derivative matrices this requirement has led toseparate programs for each system under investigation a new program through utilization of the wengert differentiationtechnique automatically determines the required matrices from specific system equations suppliedin subroutine form at execution time eliminating the need for individualized programs and presaging thefurther development of extremely general computer programs.cacm december 1966wilkins r d.ca661203 jb march 2 1978 2:44 pm1028 4 13471216 4 13471216 4 13471278 4 13471278 4 13471347 4 13471347 4 13471347 4 13471396 4 13471396 4 13471396 4 13471536 4 13471028 5 13471029 5 13471278 5 13471347 5 13471347 5 13471347 5 1347
