a correctness proof of a topology informationmain tenance protocol for a distributed computer networkin order for the nodes of a distributed computernetwork to communicate each node must have information about the network's topology since nodesand links sometimes crash a scheme is needed to update this information one of the major constrain tson such a topology information scheme is that it may not involve a central controller the topologyinformation protocol that was implemented on the merit computer network is presented and explained thisprotocol is quite general and could be implemented on any computer network it is based on baran's hotpotato heuristic routing doctrine a correctness proof of this topology information protocol is also presented.cacm july 1977tajibnapis w d.distributed computer network correctness proofs,computer networks distributed control network topology routing problem in networks distributed operatingsystem store and forward packet switching store and forward message switching traffic control3.81 4.32ca770703 jb december 28 1977 11:59 am2949 5 29492949 5 29492949 5 2949
