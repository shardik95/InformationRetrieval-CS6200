an algorithm for the blocks and cutnodes of a graphan efficient method is presented for findingblocks and cutnodes of an arbitrary undirected graph the graph may be represented either i as anordered list of edges or ii as a packed adjacency matrix if w denotes the word length of the machineemployed the storage in machine words required for a graph with n nodes and m edges increases essentiallyas 2(m+n in case i or n^2)win case ii a spanning tree with labeled edges is grown,two edges finally bearing different labels if and only if they belong to different blocks for both representationsthe time required to analyze a graph on n nodes increases as n^g where g depends on the typeof graph 1  g  2 and both bounds are attained values of g are derived for each of several suitablefamilies of test graphs generated by an extension of the web grammar approach the algorithm is comparedin detail with that proposed by read for which 1  g  3.cacm july 1971paton k.algorithm block block-cutpoint-tree cutnode fundamentalcycle set graph lobe lobe decomposition graph separable spanning tree web grammar5.32ca710705 jb february 3 1978 8:58 am1961 4 21772177 4 21772763 4 21771847 5 21772177 5 21772177 5 21772177 5 21772490 5 21772177 6 2177
