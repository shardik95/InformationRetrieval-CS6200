performance of height-balanced treesthis paper presents the results of simulationsthat investigate the performance of height-balanced hb[k trees it is shown that the only statisticof hb[1 trees avl trees that is a function of the size of the tree is the time to search for an itemin the tree for sufficiently large trees the execution times of all procedures for maintaining hb[1]trees are independent of the size of the tree in particular an average of 465 restructures are requiredper insertion with an average of 2.78 nodes revisited to restore the hb[1 property an average of 214 restructures are required per deletion with an average of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the hb[1]property moreover,the execution times of procedures for maintaining hb[k trees for k>1 are also independentof the size of the tree except for the average number of nodes revisited on a delete operation inorder to restore the hb[k property on trace back the cost of maintaining hb[k trees drops sharply as theallowable imbalance k increases both analytical and experimental results that show the cost of maintaininghb[k trees as a function of k are discussed.cacm january 1976karlton p l.fuller s h.scroggs r e.kaehler e b.hb[k trees balanced trees avl trees,information storage and retrieval searching3.7 3.72 3.74 4.49 5.39ca760104 jb january 5 1978 10:27 am2411 4 28892455 4 28892493 4 28892709 4 28892889 4 28892889 4 28892889 4 28892937 4 28892968 4 28892968 4 28892989 4 28893005 4 28893025 4 28893042 4 28893101 4 28892138 5 28892388 5 28892455 5 28892839 5 28892889 5 28892889 5 28892889 5 28893042 5 28893096 5 28893163 5 28892455 6 28892839 6 28892839 6 28892839 6 28892889 6 28892889 6 28892889 6 28892889 6 28892968 6 28893009 6 28893009 6 28893065 6 28893096 6 2889
