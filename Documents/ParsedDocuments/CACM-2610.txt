gauss harmonic interpolation formulaslet r be an open bounded simply connectedregion in the x,y)plane and let x*y be a point in r assuming r is starlike with respect to(x*y we discuss a method for computing gauss harmonic interpolation formulas for r and the point x*y such formulas approximate a harmonic function at x*y in terms of a linear combination of itsvalues at certain selected points on the boundary of r such formulas are useful for approximatingthe solution of the dirichlet problem for r.cacm august 1974stroud a h.interpolation quadrature harmonic interpolation,harmonic quadrature dirichlet problem5.13 5.16 5.17ca740814 jb january 17 1978 9:23 am2610 5 26102610 5 26102610 5 2610
