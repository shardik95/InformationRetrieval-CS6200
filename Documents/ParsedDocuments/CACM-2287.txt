a new approach to automatic scanning of contour mapsthe problem of automatic digitizing of contourmaps is discussed the structure of a general contour map is analyzed and its topological propertiesare utilized in developing a new scanning algorithm the problem of detection and recognition of contourlines is solved by a two color labeling method it is shown that for maps containing normal contour linesonly it suffices to distinguish between so-called even and odd lines the tangency problem involvedin practical scanning is discussed and a solution based on minimizing computer memory space andsimplifying control program is suggested.cacm september 1972mor m.lamdan t.automatic scanning contour maps digitizing,contour lines topology detection and recognition3.14 3.19 6.35 6.36ca720903 jb january 27 1978 4:46 pm2287 4 22872547 4 22873062 4 22871925 5 22872287 5 22872287 5 22872287 5 2287
