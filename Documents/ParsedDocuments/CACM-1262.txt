procedure-oriented language statements to facilitate parallel processingtwo statements are suggested which allow a programmerwriting in a procedure-oriented language to indicate sections of program which are to be executedin parallel the statements are do together and hold these serve partly as brackets in establishinga range of parallel operation and partly to define each parallel path within this range do togethersmay be nested the statements should be particularly effective for use with computing devices capable ofattaining some degree of compute-compute overlap.cacm may 1965opler a.ca650509 jb march 7 1978 2:17 pm1158 5 12621262 5 12621262 5 12621262 5 12621262 6 1262
