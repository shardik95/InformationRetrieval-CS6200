a simple proof of lewin's ordered-retrievaltheorem for associative memoriesan efficient method of ordered retrieval of binarywords from an associative memory as describedby lewin is based on the use of special readout circuitswhich indicate the digit values present in the individual digit columns of the memory thus thecircuits indicate whether the individual digit columns contain digits of both values or of only onevalue or contain no digits at all i.e that the memory is empty the use of these circuits whichin this paper are termed column value indicators reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessaryto retrieve in order a number of distinct words from the memory lewin proves that for the readoutby the described method of m distinct binary words 2m  1 memory accesses are necessary thus heproves that the number of necessary memory accesses of his method unlike those of other methods is independentof the word length in this paper a very simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementaryaspects of the structure of sets of binary numbers is presented.cacm july 1968wolinsky a.associative memories content-addressed memories,ordered lists ordered information retrieval ordered retrieval theorem column digit values digitvalue variety column sensing arrangement digit value readout digit variety readout memory access memoryaccess frequency ordered retrieval efficiency access frequency proof retrieval theorem proof3.74 3.79 5.29 5.31 6.31 6.36ca680704 jb february 22 1978 12:24 pm1725 5 17251725 5 17251725 5 1725
