git-a heuristic program for testing pairsof directed line graphs for isomorphism*given a pair of directed line graphs the problemof ascertaining whether or not they are isomorphic is one for which no efficient algorithmic solution is known since a straightforward enumerative algorithm might require 40 years of running time on a very highspeed computer in order to compare two 15-node graphs a more sophisticated approach seems calledfor the situation is similar to that prevailing in areas such as game-playing and theorem-proving wherepractical algorithms are unknown for the interesting cases but where various practical though only partiallysuccessful techniques are available git-graph isomorphism tester-incorporates a variety of processesthat attempt to narrow down the search for an isomorphism or to demonstrate that none exists no onescheme is relied upon exclusively for a solution and the program is designed to avoid excessive computationalong fruitless lines git has been written in the comit language and successfully tested on the ibm 7090.cacm january 1964unger s h.ca640110 jb march 10 1978 5:24 am1145 4 11451145 5 11451145 5 11451145 5 11451504 5 11453040 5 1145655 5 11451145 6 11451145 6 1145
