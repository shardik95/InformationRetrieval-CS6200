levels of language for portable softwarean increasing amount of software is beingimplemented in a portable form a popular way of accomplishing this is to encode the software in a speciallydesigned machine-independent language and then to map this language often using a macro processor,into the assembly language of each desired object machine the design of the machine-independentlanguage is the key factor in this operation this paper discusses the relative merits of pitchingthis language at a high level or a low level and presents some comparative results.cacm december 1972brown p j.portable software level of language machineindependent macro processor efficiency4.12 4.21 4.22ca721209 jb january 27 1978 11:02 am2246 5 22462246 5 22462246 5 2246
