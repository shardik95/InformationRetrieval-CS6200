a comparative analysis of disk scheduling policiesfive well-known scheduling policies for movablehead disks are compared using the performance criteria of expected seek time system oriented)and expectedwaiting time individual i/o request oriented both analytical and simulation results are obtained the variance of waiting time is introduced as another meaningful measure of performance showing possiblediscrimination against individual requests then the choice of a utility function to measure totalperformance including system oriented and individual request oriented measures is described such a functionallows one to differentiate among the scheduling policies over a wide range of input loading conditions the selection and implementation of a maximum performance two-policy algorithm are discussed.cacm march 1972teorey t j.pinkerton t b.access time analytical models auxiliary storage,direct access storage disk analysis disk scheduling performance criteria peripheral memory devices real-timesystems response time rotational delay scheduling policies seek time simulation storageunits time-sharing systems waiting time3.72 4.32 6.34ca720306jb january 31 1978 2:38 pm2375 5 23752375 5 23752375 5 23752628 5 23752891 5 23753072 5 23751713 6 23752219 6 23752245 6 23752375 6 23752375 6 23752375 6 23752496 6 23752628 6 2375
