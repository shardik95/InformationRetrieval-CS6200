copying list structures using bounded workspacetwo new algorithms are presented for list structurecopying using bounded workspace the first of primarily theoretical interest shows that withoutcell tag bits the task can be performed in time n^2 the second algorithm assuming one tag bit ineach cell delivers attractive practical speed any noncyclic structure is copied in linear speed whilecyclic structures are copied in average time less than nlogn no foreknowledge of cycle absenceis necessary to achieve linear speed a variation of the second algorithm solves an open problem concerninglist structure marking that result demonstrates that marking can be done in average time nlogn withoutthe aid of supplemental tag bits or stacks.cacm april 1974lindstrom g.list processing copying marking space complexity4.34 5.25ca740405 jb january 18 1978 9:55 am1869 4 26652513 4 26652665 4 26652665 4 26652723 4 26652855 4 26653106 4 26651383 5 26651549 5 26652665 5 26652665 5 26652665 5 26652766 5 26652954 5 26653106 5 26651549 6 2665210 6 26651972 6 26652665 6 26652665 6 26652665 6 26652766 6 26652766 6 26652855 6 26652954 6 26652998 6 2665
