a computer user-oriented systema computer language system has been developedwhich makes possible fast preparation of management reports regardless of computational complexity or formatvariety costs are sufficiently low so that individually tailored reports can be prepared for everymanager the system requires initial preparation of large data banks containing data in elementary form use of two special languages extract and matran permits selective extraction of any data subset efficientprocessing through any computational sequence and flexible presentation of results in either tabularor graphical form matrix algebra is used as a fundamental vehicle for accomplishing both manipulation and computation.cacm february 1965montillon g d.ca650215 jb march 7 1978 10:51 pm1309 4 1309892 4 13091309 5 13091309 5 13091309 5 1309656 5 1309
