a modification of efroymson's technique for stepwise regression analysisthe computational technique conventionally usedfor stepwise multiple linear regression requires the storage of an n x n matrix of data when the numberof variables n is large this requirement taxes the storage capacity of presently used machinery the near symmetry of the matrices involved permits a modification requiring only half the storage and computationsof the conventional algorithm and this additional storage allows the analysis of problems containingmore variables alternatively it permits the analysis of problems containing the same numberof variables but with all computations performed in double precision.cacm august 1968breaux h j.multiple linear regression statistical recurrenceformulas correlation linear statistical models statistical computer programs curve fitting4.0 4.40 5.0 5.5 5.10 5.13ca680805 jb february 22 1978 10:52 am1709 5 17091709 5 17091709 5 1709
