significance arithmetic on a digital computerthe 7090 at nyu has been modified to includea significance mode of operation which is intended to facilitate the identification of significant bits inthe results of floating-point arithmetic operations the manner in which floating-point arithmetic is handledin this mode is discussed several numerical experiments using this mode are described and comparisonsare made with the ordinary normalized mode examples include power series evaluation linear equationssolution determinant evaluation and matrix inversion.cacm march 1963goldstein m.ca630327 jb march 14 1978 12:47 pm3131 5 893893 5 893893 5 893893 5 893893 6 8931148 6 893
