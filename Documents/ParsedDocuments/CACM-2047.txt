incorporating origin shifts into the qralgorithm for symmetric tridiagonal matricesthe qr iteration for the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can be accelerated by incorporating a sequence of origin shifts the origin shiftmay be either subtracted directly from the diagonal elements ofthe matrix or incorporated by means of an implicit algorithm bothmethods have drawbacks the direct method can unnecessarily degrade small eigenvalues while the implicit method can effectively loose the shift and thereby retard the convergence this paper presents a new method which has neither drawback.cacm june 1970stewart g w.eigenvalues eigenvectors qr method originshifts symmetric tridiagonal matrix5.14ca700608 jb february 13 1978 11:02 am2047 5 20472047 5 20472047 5 2047
