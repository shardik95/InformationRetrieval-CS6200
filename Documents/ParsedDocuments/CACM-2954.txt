a bounded storage algorithm for copying cyclic structuresa new algorithm is presented which copies cycliclist structures using bounded workspace and linear time unlike a previous similar algorithm thisone makes no assumptions about the storage allocation system in use and uses only operations likely to be availablein a high-level language the distinctive feature of this algorithm is a technique for traversingthe structure twice using the same spanning tree in each case first from left to right and then from right to left.cacm june 1977robson j m.copying shared subtrees cyclic structures4.49 5.25ca770609 jb december 28 1977 12:56 pm2766 4 29542855 4 29542954 4 29542954 4 29543106 4 29543106 4 29542665 5 29542766 5 29542954 5 29542954 5 29542954 5 29543106 5 29541549 6 2954210 6 29541972 6 29542665 6 29542766 6 29542855 6 29542954 6 29542998 6 2954
