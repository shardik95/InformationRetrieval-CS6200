manip a computer system for algebra and analytic differentiation a mathematical expression to be operated upon is written in fortran-like notation and stored in the computer as a string of bcd characters with allblanks removed it may be as complicated as desired parentheses nested withoutrestriction etc so long as the entire expression or any subsequent form)does not exceed 5000 characters the problemm of performing algebraic operationsand obtaining analytic derivatives was translated into that of identifying andmanipulating character sequences programs which resulted were written infortran iv for a cdc 3600 and are discussed in detail.cacm august 1966bender b.ca660816 es march 17 1982 10:10 am1396 5 32023202 5 32023202 5 32023202 5 3202964 6 32021028 6 32021029 6 32021083 6 32021132 6 32021214 6 32021278 6 32021334 6 32021365 6 32021386 6 32021387 6 32021388 6 32021392 6 32021393 6 32021394 6 32021395 6 32021396 6 32021397 6 32021496 6 3202284 6 3202407 6 32023199 6 32023200 6 32023201 6 32023202 6 32023203 6 32023204 6 3202561 6 3202730 6 3202
