new methods to color the vertices of a graphthis paper describes efficient new heuristicmethods to color the vertices of a graph which relyupon the comparison of the degrees and structure of a graph a methodis developed which is exact for bipartite graphs and is animportant part of heuristic procedures to find maximal cliques in generalgraphs finally an exact method is given which performs betterthan the randall-brown algorithm and is able to color largergraphs and the new heuristic methods the classical methods andthe exact method are compared cacm april 1979brelaz d.np-complete graph structure balancing graphcoloring scheduling comparison of the methods5.25 5.32ca790405 dh june 5 1979 2:05 pm3139 5 31393139 5 31393139 5 3139
