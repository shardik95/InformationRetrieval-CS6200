on a divide-and-correct method for variable precision divisiondescribed in this paper is a divide-and-correctmethod for variable precision division in digital computers unlike the earlier methods of stein andpope the present method uses a suitably rounded form of the normalized divisor for getting an estimateof the quotient characters this results in a correction of at most plus or minus one to the estimate,to obtain the exact quotient character it is believed that this method will be widely applicablefor division operations in variable word-length character-oriented machines.cacm march 1965krishnamurthy e v.ca650315jb march 7 1978 4:16 pm1026 4 12921258 4 12921258 4 12921292 4 12921292 4 12921497 4 12921497 4 12921975 4 12922605 4 1292107 5 12921026 5 12921292 5 12921292 5 12921292 5 12921497 5 12921593 5 12921975 5 1292107 6 12921026 6 12921026 6 12921292 6 12921292 6 12921292 6 12921497 6 12921593 6 129291 6 1292
