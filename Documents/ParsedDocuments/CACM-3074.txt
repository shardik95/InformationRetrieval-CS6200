a time and space efficient garbage compaction algorithmgiven an area of storage containing scattered,marked nodes of differing sizes one may wish to rearrange them into a compact mass at one end of thearea while revising all pointers to marked nodes to show their new locations an algorithm is describedhere which accomplishes this task in linear time relative to the size of the storage area and in a spaceof the order of one bit for each pointer the algorithm operates by reversibly encoding the situation(that a collection of locations point to a single location by a linear list emanating from the pointed-tolocation passing through the pointing locations and terminating with the pointed-to location's transplanted contents.cacm august 1978morris f.garbage collection compaction compact ification,storage reclamation storage allocation record structures relocation list processing free storage pointers data structures4.34 4.49 5.32ca780804 dh february 7 1979 10:16 am1972 4 30741972 4 30742156 4 30742156 4 30742168 4 30742249 4 30742361 4 30742438 4 30742513 4 30742723 4 30742736 4 30742736 4 30742736 4 30742833 4 30742838 4 30742855 4 30742855 4 30742896 4 30743039 4 30743074 4 30743074 4 30743074 4 30743074 4 30743106 4 30743112 4 30743112 4 30743112 4 30741826 5 30741853 5 30741972 5 30742723 5 30743074 5 30743074 5 30743074 5 3074
