permutation of data blocks in a bubble memorya common internal organization of bubble memories consists of a set of minor loops connected through another major loop the problem of obtaining any give n permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studiedin this paper a lower bound to the number of steps required buya permutation algorithm is derived and the class of optimum algorithms is identified.cacm january 1979bongiovanni g.luccio f.bubble memory memory loops permutation algorithm data block shift4.34 5.30 6.34ca790103 dh april 10 1979 12:04 pm3118 5 31183118 5 31183118 5 3118
