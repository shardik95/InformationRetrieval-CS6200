occurrences of cycling and other phenomenaarising in a class of linear programming modelsan investigation into the average queue sizefor a certain class of queues has resulted in the formulation of linear programming problems whichare ill-conditioned in some cases in attempting to solve these linear programming models using ibm'smps package instances of cycling were encountered small perturbations in the input data resulted in problemswhich did not cycle this fact plus several other observed phenomena suggest that the primary reasonthat cycling is not known to occur more frequently is the round-off errors in the computations perturbthe problem sufficiently to prevent cycling or at least to prevent indefinite cycling in one case maximizingand minimizing an objective function subject to the same constrain t set was attempted but mps solvedonly one of these while giving an indication of infeasibility for the other.cacm february 1977kotiah t c t.steinberg d i.linear programming cycling queueing models5.41 5.9ca770208 jb december 30 1977 2:11 am2993 5 29932993 5 29932993 5 2993
