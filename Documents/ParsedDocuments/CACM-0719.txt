variable width stackscharacter addressable variable field computerspermit ready establishment and manipulation of variable width stacks single machine commands maypush variable field items down into such stacks or pop them up the availability of a variety of fielddelimiters allows the machine to push down or pop up more than one variable width item with one command since these stacking operations can be made the basis of compiler decoding algorithms the properuse of machines of this class for compilation has advantages over machines with fixed-length words.cacm october 1963rotenberg n.opler a.ca631006 jb march 13 1978 6:25 pm719 5 719719 5 719719 5 719
