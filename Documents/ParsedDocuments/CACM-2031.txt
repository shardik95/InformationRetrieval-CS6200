algorithm and bound for the greatest common divisor of n integersa new version of the euclideanalgorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of n integers a(i)and multipliers x(i such that gcd  x(1)a(1    x(n)a(n)is presented the number of arithmetic operations and the numberof storage locations are linear in n a theorem of lame that gives a bound for the number of iterations of the euclidean algorithm for two integers is extended to the case of n integers an algorithm to construct a minimal set of multipliers is presented a fortran program for the algorithm appears as comm acm algorithm 386.cacm july 1970bradley g h.greatest common divisor euclidean algorithm,number theory diophantine equations3.15 5.10ca700706 jb february 13 1978 8:45 am2031 4 20312031 4 20311022 5 20312028 5 20312031 5 20312031 5 20312031 5 20312521 5 2031450 5 20313099 5 20311313 6 20312028 6 20312031 6 20312031 6 20312031 6 20313135 6 2031
