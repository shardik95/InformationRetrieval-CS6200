on generation of test problems for linear programming codesusers of linear programming computer codes haverealized the necessity of evaluating the capacity effectiveness and accuracy of the solutions providedby such codes large scale linear programming codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correctsolutions without ever having been bench-marked by test problems with known solutions the reason forthis failure to adequately test the codes is that rarely are there large problems with known solutions readilyavailable this paper presents a theoretical justification and an illustrative implementation of a methodfor generating linear programming test problems with known solutions the method permits the generationof test problems that are of arbitrary size and have a wide range of numerical characteristics.cacm october 1974charnes a.raike w m.stutz j d.walters a s.linear programming test problem generation,lp program evaluation lp program validation5.41ca741006 jb january 16 1978 12:28 pm2592 5 25922592 5 25922592 5 2592
