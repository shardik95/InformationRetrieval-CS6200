dynamic storage allocation systemsin many recent computer system designs hardwarefacilities have been provided for easing the problems of storage allocation a method of characterizingdynamic storage allocation systems-according to the functional capabilities provided and the underlyingtechniques used-is presented the basic purpose of the paper is to provide a useful perspective fromwhich the utility of various hardware facilities may be assessed a brief survey of storage allocationfacilities in several representative computer systems is included as an appendix.cacm may 1968randell b.kuehner c j.segmentation paging multiprogramming storageallocation storage management virtual memories storage fragmentation storage hierarchies addressing mechanisms4.30 6.20ca680502 jb february 23 1978 9:49 am1754 4 17541754 4 17542358 4 1754488 4 1754274 5 17541754 5 17541754 5 17541754 5 17541879 5 17541884 5 17541901 5 1754376 5 17542095 5 17542277 5 17542297 5 17542365 5 1754168 6 1754185 6 1754987 6 17541728 6 17541728 6 17541751 6 17541751 6 17541751 6 17541754 6 17541754 6 17541754 6 17541754 6 17541754 6 17541754 6 17541754 6 17541879 6 17541924 6 17542362 6 1754
