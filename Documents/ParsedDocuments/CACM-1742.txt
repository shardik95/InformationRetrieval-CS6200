on the design of display processorsthe flexibility and power needed in the datachannel for a computer display are considered to work efficiently such a channel must have a sufficient numberof instructions that it is best understood as a small processor rather than a powerful channel as it was found that successive improvements to the display processor design lie on a circular path bymaking improvements one can return to the original simple design plus one new general purpose computer foreach trip around the degree of physical separation between display and parent computer is a key factor in display processor design.cacm june 1968myer t h.display processor design display system computergraphics graphic terminal displays graphics display generator display channel display programming,graphical interaction remote displays2.44 6.22 6.29 6.35ca680603 jb february 22 1978 4:41 pm1742 5 17421742 5 17421742 5 1742
