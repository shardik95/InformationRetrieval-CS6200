optimal balancing of i/o requests to disksdetermining a policy for efficient allocationand utilization of a set of disk drives with differing operational characteristics is examined usinganalytical techniques using standard queueing theory each disk drive is characterized by a queueingmodel with service time of a disk drive represented by the probability density function of the sum of twouniform distributions total response time of the set of disk models is then minimized under varyingload conditions the results indicate that faster devices should have higher utilization factors and thatthe number of different device types utilized tends to decrease with decreasing load specific examplesusing 2314 and 3330 combinations are examined.cacm september 1975piepmeier w f.disk drive hierarchies system evaluation input/output,modeling queueing theory balancing scheduling device assignment2.44 4.35 5.15 5.5 6.35 8.1 8.3ca750904 jb january 6 1978 2:42 pm2720 5 27202720 5 27202720 5 2720
