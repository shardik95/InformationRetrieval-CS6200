characteristics of program localitiesthe term locality has been used to denote thatsubset of a program's segments which are referenced during a particular phase of its execution a program'sbehavior can be characterized in terms of its residence in localities of various sizes and lifetimes,and the transitions between these localities in this paper the concept of a locality is made more explicitthrough a formal definition of what constitutes a phase of localized reference behavior and by a correspondingmechanism for the detection of localities in actual reference strings this definition providesfor the existence of a hierarchy of localities at any given time and the reasonableness of the definitionis supported by examples taken from actual programs empirical data from a sample of productionalgol 60 programs is used to display distributions of locality sizes and lifetimes and these results arediscussed in terms of their implications for the modeling of program behavior and memory management in virtual memory systems.cacm may 1976madison a w.batson a p.program behavior memory management locality4.22 4.35 4.6 4.9 6.21ca760507 jb january 4 1978 3:15 pm2864 5 28642864 5 28642864 5 28643000 5 28643067 5 28641751 6 28641879 6 28642095 6 28642374 6 28642373 6 28642595 6 28642682 6 28642863 6 28642864 6 28642864 6 28643006 6 2864
