introduction to feature analysis ofgeneralized data base management systems"this paper is a separately published introductionto a main report which analyzes the features of generalized data base management systems this introductiongives a review of the current state of the art in these systems and discusses the differencesand similarities between capabilities found in host language systems and those found in self-containedsystems after some discussion of the problems of data independence and binding,the four user levelsare identified and described technical problems facing future designers are described the first ofthese is that of handling existing stored data and the next is that of providing more complex data structuresthan those already available in conventional programming languages the problem of high level interrogationand update functions acting on network structures is mentioned followed by a discussion of theproblem of catering to a high volume of transactions initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowestlevel of user the use of cobol as a basis for further development work is considered at some lengthwith respect to data structures host language capabilities and self-contained capabilities thissection also assesses the effect of the data base task group proposals the final section outlines theten major topics in the main body of the full report.cacm may 1971codasyl systems committeedata base management systems programming languages,data structures storage structures information retrieval transaction processing3.5 3.70 3.72 3.73 3.74 4.29ca710501 jb february 3 1978 3:18 pm2198 5 21982198 5 21982198 5 21982452 5 21982882 5 2198849 6 21981936 6 21981976 6 21982198 6 21982198 6 21982452 6 2198627 6 2198
