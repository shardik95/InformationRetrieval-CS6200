scheduling to reduce conflict in meetingsconflicts in scheduling can be treated as defining an undirected linear graph independently of the relation of the activities in conflict to additional constraints of time and space each connected component of such a graph,which can be found by an algorithm described by gotlieb and corneil corresponds to a set of events that must be scheduled at different times.cacm june 1970grimes j e.allocation conflict matrix connected component scheduling spanningtree undirected linear graph1.90 3.51 3.59 5.32ca700603 jb february 13 1978 11:55 am1609 4 20521847 4 20521961 4 20522052 4 20522052 4 20522052 4 20522052 4 20522209 4 20521008 5 20521013 5 20521504 5 20521540 5 20522052 5 20522052 5 20522052 5 2052
