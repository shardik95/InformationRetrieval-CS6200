automation of program debugging automatic debugging can substantially reduce lead-time between the codingand the effective use of a complex program it also enforces analysis ofdebugging criteria resulting in verifiably accurate programs the programmerspecifies the program to be debugged memory areas set of input data maximumrepetition of loops and checkpoint information for each set of data theexecutive debugging program the runs the program to be debugged performingchecking functions and creating a trace record of its own later analysis andlocation of errors applications are quite flexible and the system can be usedalone or in conjunction with other debugging techniques.cacm july 1961jacoby k.layton h.ca610714 es march 17 1982 10:10 am931 5 396396 5 396396 5 396396 5 396202 6 396396 6 396634 6 396
