the eschenbach drum schemethe prime function of a drum operating inreal time is to perform accesses quickly the usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporateengineering or hardware improvements in this paper the problem is attacked not by changing thedrum but rather by modifying the manner in which it operates at the outset a drum is given a functionaldefinition then a simple design scheme eschenbach is introduced which enormously increases the rate ofaccessing for drums so defined this is shown to enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer orless expensive drums it is suggested that although the design scheme has a specific use the method underlying ithas more general applicability the question of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised todeal with this a standard of efficiency is developed in light of realistic real-time circumstances the drumscheme is then modelled in a manner which permits it to be analyzed as a problem in queueing theory thus one is enabled to ascertain whether the drum scheme is efficient enough for its application again,whereas the analysis of the drum scheme has a specific use the methods underlying it have more general applicability.cacm july 1966weingarten a.ca660706 jb march 2 1978 9:29 pm1408 5 14081408 5 14081408 5 14082319 5 14081408 6 14081719 6 14081749 6 14081751 6 14082016 6 14082017 6 14082080 6 14082188 6 14082203 6 14082204 6 1408
