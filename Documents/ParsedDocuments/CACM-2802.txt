the new math of computer programmingstructured programming has proved to be an importantmethodology for systematic program design and development structured programs are identifiedas compound function expressions in the algebra of functions the algebraic properties of these functionexpressions permit the reformulation expansion as well as reduction of a nested subexpression independentlyof its environment thus modeling what is known as stepwise program refinement as well as programexecution finally structured programming is characterized in terms of the selection and solutionof certain elementary equations defined in the algebra of functions these solutions can be given ingeneral formulas each involving a single parameter which display the entire freedom availablein creating correct structured programs.cacm january 1975mills h d.structured programming algebra of functions,stepwise refinement program correctness4.6 5.21 5.24ca750109 jb january 12 1978 9:50 am2709 4 28022802 4 28023004 4 28021425 5 28022802 5 28022802 5 28022802 5 2802
