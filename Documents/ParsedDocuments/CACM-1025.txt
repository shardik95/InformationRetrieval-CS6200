a method of syntax-checking algol 60a syntax checker was designed based on the syntaxof algol as described in the algol 60 report communications of the acm may 1960 since the definitionof the elements of the language is recursive it seemed most desirable to design the syntax checkeras a set of mutually recursive processors tied together by subroutines which perform certain bookkeepingfunctions because of the recursive nature of the language and of the syntax checker the problemof recovery after an error required much attention a method was devised which permits most programsto be checked completely despite errors.cacm august 1964lietzke m p.ca640805 jb march 9 1978 7:24 pm1025 5 10251025 5 10251025 5 10251215 5 10251682 5 10251025 6 10251025 6 10251785 6 1025224 6 1025763 6 1025
