an improved algorithm for decentralized extrema-findingin circular configurations of processesthis note presents an improvement to lelann'salgorithm for finding the largest or smallest of a set of uniquelynumbered processes arranged in a circle in which no centralcontroller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori.this decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selectivemessage extinction in order to achieve an average number ofmessage passes of order n log n rather than o(n2 cacm may 1979chang e.roberts r.decentralized algorithms distributed systems operating systems4.32 4.35 5.25 5.32ca790502 dh june 5 1979 2:35 pm3141 5 31413141 5 31413141 5 3141
