a note on computing approximations to the exponential functiontwo methods are discussed which result in nearminimax rational approximations to the exponential function and at the same time retain the desirable propertythat the approximation for negative values of the argument is the reciprocal of the approximationfor corresponding positive values these methods lead to approximations which are much superior to thecommonly used convergents of the gaussian continued fraction for the exponential coefficients and errorsare given for the intervals 5*ln 2 5*ln 2 and ln 2 ln 2]cacm january 1967cody w j.ralston a.ca670110jb february 28 1978 4:25 pm1015 4 16451346 4 16451440 4 16451645 4 1645951 4 16451645 5 16451645 5 16451645 5 1645532 5 1645
