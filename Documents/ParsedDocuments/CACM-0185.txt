multiprogram scheduling parts 1 and 2 introduction and theory*in order to exploit fully a fast computer whichpossesses simultaneous processing abilities it should to a large extent schedule its own workload the scheduling routine must be capable of extremely rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating the construction of a schedule entails determining which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentiallywith respect to each other a concise scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimizethe time for executing the entire pending workload or any subset of it subject to external constraintssuch as precedence urgency etc the algorithm is applicable to a wide class of machines.cacm june 1960codd e f.ca600605 jb march 20 1978 9:46 pm185 5 185185 5 185185 5 1851713 5 1851901 5 185491 5 185168 6 185168 6 185168 6 185185 6 185185 6 185185 6 185196 6 1851751 6 1851754 6 18546 6 185
