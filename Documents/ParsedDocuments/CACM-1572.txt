the simulation of time sharing systemsthe development of new large scale time-sharingsystems has raised a number of problems for computation center management not only is it necessaryto develop an appropriate hardware configuration for these systems but appropriate software adjustmentsmust be made unfortunately these systems often do not respond to changes in the manner that intuitionwould suggest and there are few guides to assist in the analysis of performance characteristics thedevelopment of a comprehensive simulation model to assist in the investigation of these questions isdescribed in this paper the resulting model has a general purpose design and can be used to study avariety of time-sharing systems it can also be used to assist in the design and development of new time-sharingalgorithms or techniques for the sake of efficiency and greater applicability the model wasimplemented in a limited fortran subset that is compatible with most fortran iv compilers the use ofthe simulation is demonstrated by a study of the ibm 360/67 time-sharing system.cacm july 1967nielsen n r.ca670701 jb february 28 1978 9:15 am1572 5 15721572 5 15721572 5 15721805 5 15721846 5 15721892 5 15722188 5 15722218 5 15722317 5 15721198 6 15721380 6 15721380 6 15721424 6 15721484 6 15721518 6 15721526 6 15721572 6 15721572 6 15721572 6 15721572 6 15721572 6 15721572 6 15721693 6 15721728 6 15721728 6 15721748 6 15721749 6 15721751 6 15721751 6 15721753 6 15721752 6 15721752 6 15721781 6 15721810 6 15721879 6 15722095 6 15722126 6 15722148 6 1572576 6 1572
