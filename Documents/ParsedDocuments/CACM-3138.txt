a mathematical programming updating method using modifiedgivens transformations and applied to lp problemsan efficient and numerically stable method is presented for the problem ofupdating an orthogonal decomposition of a matrix of column or row vectors.the fundamental idea is to add a column or row analogousto adding an additional row of data in a linear least squares problem.a column or row is dropped by a formal scaling with theimaginary unit 1 followed by least squares addition of the column(or row the elimination process for the procedure is successivessive application of the givens transformation in modified more efficient)form these ideas are illustrated with an implementationof the revised simplex method the algorithm is a general purposeone that does not account for any particular structure or sparsityin the equations some suggested computational tests for determiningsigns of various controlling parameters in the revised simplexalgorithm are mentioned a simple means of constructingtest cases and some sample computing times are presented cacm april 1979hanson r.wisniewski j.linear programming numerical linear algebra modified givens transformations,linear programming test cases5 5.4 5.41 5.1 5.14ca790404 dh may 21 1979 2:06 pm3099 4 31383138 4 31381313 5 31383138 5 31383138 5 31383138 5 3138
