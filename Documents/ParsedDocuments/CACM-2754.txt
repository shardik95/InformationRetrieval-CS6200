a syntactic algorithm for peak detectionin waveforms with applications to cardiographypeaks in a digitized waveform are detected by analgorithm incorporating piecewise linear approximation and tabular parsing techniques several parameters serveto identify the waveform context enabling accurate measurement of peak amplitude duration and shape thealgorithm is of sufficient speed to allow on-line real-time processing an example of its applicationis demonstrated on an electrocardiogram.cacm may 1975horowitz s l.peak detection digitized waveform piecewise linearapproximation context-free grammar bottom-up parsing electrocardiogram.3.12 3.24 3.34 3.63 4.19 5.13 5.23ca750513 jb january 9 1978 2:18 pm2754 5 27542754 5 27542754 5 2754
