experiments in text file compressiona system for the compression of data files,viewed as strings of characters is presented the method is general and applies equally well toenglish to pl/i or to digital data the system consists of an encoder an analysis program and a decoder two algorithms for encoding a string differ slightly from earlier proposals the analysis program attemptsto find an optimal set of codes for representing substrings of the file four new algorithms for thisoperation are described and compared various parameters in the algorithms are optimized to obtaina high degree of compression for sample texts.cacm november 1976rubin f.text compression data file compaction huffmancodes n-gram encoding comparison of algorithms3.7 3.73 4.33ca761104 jb january 3 1978 3:26 pm2530 4 28192623 4 28192819 4 28192537 5 28192819 5 28192819 5 28192819 5 2819
