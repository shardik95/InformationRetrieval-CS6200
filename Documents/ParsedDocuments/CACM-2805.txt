perturbations of eigenvalues of non-normal matricesthe problem considered is to give bounds for finiteperturbations of simple and multiple eigenvalues of nonnormal matrices where these bounds are in termsof the eigenvalues the departure from normality and the frobenius norm of the perturbation matrix butnot in terms of the eigen system the bounds which are derived are shown to be almost attainable for any set of matrices cacm january 1975van der sluis a.perturbation of eigenvalues non-normal matrices,departure from normality gershgorin circles5.14ca750106 jb january 12 1978 10:31 am2805 5 28052805 5 28052805 5 2805
