on arithmetic expressions and treesa description is given of how a tree representing theevaluation of an arithmetic expression can be drawn in such a way that the number of accumulatorsneeded for the computation can be represented in a straightforward manner this representation reducesthe choice of the best order of computation to a specific problem under the theory of graphs an algorithm to solve this problem is presented.cacm february 1969redziejowski r r.arithmetic expression compiler design graph theory,programming storage minimization topological ordering,tree4.12 5.32ca690204 jb february 20 1978 11:11 am1807 4 19341934 4 19342175 4 19341551 5 19341934 5 19341934 5 19341934 5 1934
