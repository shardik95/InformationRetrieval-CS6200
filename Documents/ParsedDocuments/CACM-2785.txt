glypnir-a programming language for illiac ivglypnir is one of the earliest existing languagesdesigned for programming the illiac iv computer the syntax of the language is based on algol 60 but hasbeen extended to allow the programmer explicitly to specify the parallelism of his algorithm in terms of 64-wordvectors this paper describes the characteristics goals and philosophy of the language and discusses someof the problems associated with parallel computer architectures.cacm march 1975lawrie d h.layman t.baer d.randal j m.glypnir illiac iv programming language,parallel computation parallel architecture4.2 4.21 4.22ca750303jb january 9 1978 4:57 pm2785 4 27852785 4 27852876 4 27852433 5 27852685 5 27852785 5 27852785 5 27852785 5 2785
