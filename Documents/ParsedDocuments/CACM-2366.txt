complex gamma function with error controlan algorithm to compute the gamma function andlog gamma function of a complex variable is presented the standard algorithm is modified in several respectsto insure the continuity of the function value and to reduce accumulation of round-off errors inaddition to computation of function values this algorithm includes an object-time estimation of round-offerrors experimental data with regard to the effectiveness of this error control are presented a fortran program for the algorithm appears in the algorithms section of this issue.cacm april 1972kuki h.complex gamma function gamma function complexlog gamma function loggamma function round-off error control inherent error control run-time error estimates error estimates5.11 5.12ca720407 jb january 31 1978 12:59 pm2366 4 23662364 5 23662366 5 23662366 5 23662366 5 23662366 6 2366
