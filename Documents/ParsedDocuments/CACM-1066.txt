growing applications of linear programminguse of linear programming models has grown soextensively in recent years that the whole concept for organizing a computer code has undergone a radicalchange it no longer is adequate merely to reduce a mathematical algorithm i.e the simplex method toa computer code an advanced code must cope with such a variety of situations that the respective computersubprograms must be organized into an integrated system emphasis in this paper is devoted to the underlyingprinciples upon which future linear programming systems must be based these viewpoints are influencedby the new demands that applications within the petroleum industry are placing on such systems someof the components of such a system are translation of problem statement in terms of basic data to linearprogramming matrix coefficients data transmission for direct computer entry data file at the computer center,data processing and editing prior to solving the simplex algorithm an efficient and reliable codefor solving the above-mentioned algorithm and flexible means for summarizing the results.cacm june 1964aronofsky j s.ca640601 jb march 9 1978 9:55 pm1066 5 10661066 5 10661066 5 1066
