problems in the statistical analysis of simulationexperiments the comparison of means and the length of sample recordsresearch is continued into statistical analysisof simulation experiments containing autocorrelated time series it is shown how to estimate the lengthsof sample records needed to use certain large sample results in measuring stability analogies between autocorrelateddata and independent observations are described a way to test the difference of the meanof two experiments is suggested it is shown how the variance of the sample mean relates to the spectrumof the generating process and estimation of the quantities of interest is described the resultsexpand the possibilities of statistical spectral analysis as applied to simulation experiments.cacm february 1967fishman g s.ca670205 jb february 28 1978 3:34 pm1637 5 16371637 5 16371637 5 1637
