a cost oriented algorithm for data set allocation in storage hierarchiesdata set allocation in today's multilevelstorage systems is usually based on qualitative ad hoc decisions while it would be desirable to obtainan optimal solution to this allocation problem it is clear that the number of parameters involved makesit intractable to straight-forward solution in such a situation we must find a set of assumptionswhich simplify the problem greatly but which still provide a basis for considering all significantcost elements this paper presents such a first quantitative allocation step it considers many of thesignificant detailed costs of system utilization data storage data staging and data migration althoughmany avenues of further improvement are available the present algorithm seems to be usefully accurate.as such it can aid in quantifying the problems of data set allocation storage system configuration and new device designs.cacm june 1975lum v y.senko m ewang c p.ling h.data set allocation hierarchical storage storagesystem configuration data staging data migration storage allocation analysis3.5 3.9 6.2ca750603 jb january 9 1978 1:31 pm2750 5 27502750 5 27502750 5 2750
