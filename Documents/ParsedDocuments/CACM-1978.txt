the use of interactive graphics to solve numerical problemswith the advent of on-line time-sharing computer systemsand graphic terminals we have available a new dimensionin numerical problem solving capabilities rather than simply usethe new power to achieve fast turnaround we can develop interactiveroutines which are easy to use and also take advantage of theinsight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver severalon-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solvinghave already been implemented as well as some special purposesystems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinarydifferential equations the advantage of restricting the problemarea is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified.in this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by suchsystems and design considerations for interactive routines furthermore,an implementation of an on-line least squares data-fittingprogram peg is presented with results obtained from empiricaldata in conclusion area for future work in this field are discussed.cacm october 1970smith l b.interactive graphics computer graphics graphics least squares,data-fitting interactive computing on-line mathematics1.3 3.1 5.13 5.5ca701012 jb february 10 1978 9:14 am1978 4 19781978 4 19781978 4 19781307 5 19781589 5 19781813 5 19781978 5 19781978 5 19781978 5 1978
