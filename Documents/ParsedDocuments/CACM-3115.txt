orderly enumeration of nonsingular binarymatrices applied to text encryptionnonsingular binary matrices of order n i.e.nonsingular over the field 0 1 and an initial segment of the natural numbers are placed in one-to-onecorrespondence each natural number corresponds to two intermediate vectors these vectors are mapped intoa nonsingular binary matrix examples of complete enumeration of all 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 nonsingularbinary matrices were produced by mapping the intermediate vectors to the matrices the mappinghas application to the vernam encipherment method using pseudorandom number sequences a bit string formedform bytes of text of a data encryption key can be used as a representation of a natural number this natural number is transformed to a nonsingular binary matrix key leverage is obtained by using thematrix as a"seed in a shift register sequence pseudorandom number generator cacm april 1978payne w.mcmillen k.binary matrices combinatorics combinations nonsingularmatrices encryption vernam pseudorandom numbers feedback shiftregister sequences random numbers.3.7 5.3ca780401 dh february 27 1979 11:05 am2269 4 31152466 4 31152690 4 31152834 4 31152834 4 31152834 4 31152853 4 31152884 4 31152908 4 31153115 4 31153115 4 31153115 4 31153115 4 31153115 4 31153115 4 31153115 4 3115907 5 31152045 5 31152417 5 31152466 5 31152884 5 3115579 5 31153115 5 31153115 5 31153115 5 3115785 5 3115
