optimizing the performance of a relational algebra database interfacean approach for implementing a smart interfaceto support a relational view of data is proposed the basic idea is to employ automatic programming techniquesso that the interface analyzes and efficiently refines the high level query specification supplied bythe user a relational algebra interface called squiral which was designed using this approach is describedin detail squiral seeks to minimize query response time and space utilization by 1 performingglobal query optimization 2 exploiting disjoint and pipelined concurrency 3 coordinating sort ordersin temporary relations 4 employing directory analysis and 5 maintaining locality in page references algorithms for implementing the operators of e f codd's relational algebra are presented anda methodology for composing them to optimize the performance of a particular user query is described.cacm october 1975smith j m.yen-tang chang p.relational database database optimization invertedfile automatic programming query language data manipulation language very high level language3.70 4.13 4.33ca751003 jb january 6 1978 11:19 am2155 4 27162406 4 27162710 4 27162710 4 27162715 4 27162716 4 27162716 4 27162717 4 27162718 4 27162765 4 27162817 4 27162888 4 27162901 4 27162901 4 27162957 4 27162959 4 27162965 4 27163087 4 27163154 4 27162046 5 27162715 5 27162716 5 27162716 5 27162716 5 2716
