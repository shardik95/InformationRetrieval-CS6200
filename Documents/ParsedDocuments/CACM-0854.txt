some characteristics of sorting in computingsystems using random access storage devices the substantial differences in characteristicsof random access storage and tape devices dictate that concepts and objectives of computer program designbe considered from the viewpoint of the external file medium used this is particularly true in thecase of sorting in a tape-oriented system the major sorting problem is that of minimizing merge timedespite the limited orders of merge possible in contrast sorting in a random access-oriented systemencourages the selection of the optimum order of merge from many possible orders the latter problemis discussed in this paper along with criteria developed for determining the optimum order of merge accordingto the various properties of random access storage devices attention is also given to the problemof key sorting versus record sorting and the possibly serious disadvantage of key sorting on a random access system.cacm may 1963hubbard g u.ca630513 jb march 14 1978 11:05 am1956 5 8542017 5 854854 5 854854 5 854854 5 854849 6 854850 6 854851 6 854852 6 854853 6 854854 6 854854 6 854855 6 854856 6 854857 6 854858 6 854859 6 854860 6 854861 6 854862 6 854863 6 854864 6 854865 6 854866 6 854
