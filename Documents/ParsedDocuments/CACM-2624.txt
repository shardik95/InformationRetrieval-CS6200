formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architecturesvirtual machine systems have been implementedon a limited number of third generation computer systems e.g cp-67 on the ibm 360/67 from previousempirical studies it is known that certain third generation computer systems e.g the dec pdp-10 cannotsupport a virtual machine system in this paper model of a third-generation-like computer system isdeveloped formal techniques are used to derive precise sufficient conditions to test whether suchan architecture can support virtual machines.cacm july 1974popek g j.goldberg r p.operating system third generation architecture,sensitive instruction formal requirements abstract model proof virtual machine virtual memory,hypervisor virtual machine monitor4.32 4.35 5.21 5.22ca740707 jb january 17 1978 11:19 am2624 5 26242624 5 26242624 5 26243144 5 26241471 6 26242298 6 26242491 6 26242597 6 26242624 6 26242625 6 26242632 6 2624
