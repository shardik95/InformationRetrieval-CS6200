the description list of conceptsa concept is defined as a class of objectswhose members can be distinguished by processing its properties property is defined to mean a partitionof the set of all objects into disjoint classes the formal definition of a concept is recursive in nature a concept is described by a list structure a one-to-one correspondence is established between therecursive definition of a concept and its description list structure like the definition the descriptionlist structure of a concept is also built up from elementary list structures by a recursive process the list structures obtained this way are compared with the description list structure discussedby the author in a previous publication.cacm august 1962banerji r b.ca620801 jb march 17 1978 7:39 pm527 5 527527 5 527527 5 527
