weighted derivation treesthe nodes of a weighted derivation tree are associatedwith weighting functions over the vocabulary of a context-free grammar an algorithm is presentedfor constructing the optimal derivation tree having the same structure as a given weighted derivation tree in addition the correctness of the algorithm is established the method may be applied to problemsinvolving probabilistic parsing or combinatorial optimization.cacm september 1976loui m c.derivation tree parse tree probabilistic grammar,structural ambiguity combinatorial optimization5.23 5.49ca760903 jb january 4 1978 9:41 am2836 5 28362836 5 28362836 5 2836
