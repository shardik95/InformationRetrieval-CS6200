high-level data flow analysisin contrast to the predominant use of low-levelin termediate text high-level data flow analysis deals with programs essentially at source level andexploits the control flow information implicit in the parse tree the need for high-level flow analysisarises from several aspects of recent work on advanced methods of program certification and optimization this paper proposes a simple general method of high-level data flow analysis that allows free useof escape and jump statements avoids large graphs when compiling large programs facilitates updating ofdata flow information to reflect program changes and derives new global information helpful in solvingmany familiar global flow analysis problems an illustrative application to live variable analysis is presented many of the graphs involved are constructed and analyzed before any programs are compiled thus avoidingcertain costs that low-level methods incur repeatedly at compile time.cacm october 1977rosen b k.data flow analysis high-level language controlflow graph structured programming escapes exits jumps goto statements5.24 4.12 4.22ca771003 jb december 27 1977 11:41 am1807 4 29232034 4 29232290 4 29232579 4 29232579 4 29232923 4 29232923 4 29232945 4 29231807 5 29231947 5 29232923 5 29232923 5 29232923 5 2923
