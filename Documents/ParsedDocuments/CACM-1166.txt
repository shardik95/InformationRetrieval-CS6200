a use of macros in translation of symbolicassembly language of one computer to anothera set of macro-operations has been preparedto assist in translating ibm 7090 symbolic assembly language programs to ibm 7040 machine language programs this set inserted at the beginning of the 7090 symbolic deck treats incompatible instruction mnemonicsas macro-instructions to produce equivalent 7040 instruction sets incompatible instructions arecategorized into basic operational classes which can be expressed by a single basic skeleton several levelsof macro calls are required to supply arguments to the basic skeleton for each particular instruction modification at execution time of the address or tag of an incompatible instruction requires incorporationof an address-tag equivalent i/o is handled by generating calls to i/o simulation subroutines.cacm december 1965dellert jr g t.ca651203 jb march 6 1978 4:20 pm1166 5 11661166 5 11661166 5 1166
