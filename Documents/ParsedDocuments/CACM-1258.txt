an extended arithmetic packagein many fields for example algebraic numbertheory arithmetic must be carried out to a degree of precision which exceeds the normal hardware capacityof most machines in such cases an extended arithmetic package provides a comprehensive and easy-to-useway of performing such arithmetic such a package was coded for the ibm 7090 in discussingthe general problems associated with the design of an extended arithmetic package specific reference is made to this program.cacm may 1965blum b i.ca650513 jb march 7 1978 1:01 pm1026 4 12581258 4 12581258 4 12581292 4 12581292 4 12581497 4 12581497 4 12581975 4 12582605 4 1258107 5 12581026 5 12581258 5 12581258 5 12581258 5 1258
