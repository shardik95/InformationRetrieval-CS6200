an iterative factorization technique for polynomialsan iterative technique is displayed whereby factorsof arbitrary degree can be found for polynomials in one variable convergence is shown to occur alwaysif a certain jacobian does not vanish and if the initial approximation to a factor is near enough to anactual factor the process is simply programmed and preliminary results indicate it to be well adaptedto use with digital computers for factors of degree two the technique is similar to that of bairstow,the present method being somewhat simpler.cacm march 1963luther h a.ca630326 jb march 14 1978 12:51 pm1111 5 894894 5 894894 5 894894 5 894894 6 894
