optimal surface reconstruction from planar contoursin many scientific and technical endeavors,a three-dimensional solid must be reconstructed from serial sections either to aid in the comprehensionof the object's structure or to facilitate its automatic manipulation and analysis this paper presentsa general solution to the problem of constructing a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours this surface to be composed of triangular tiles is constructed by separately determining an optimalsurface between each pair of consecutive contours determining such a surface is reduced to the problemof finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed toroidal graph a new fast algorithm for finding suchcycles is utilized also developed is a closed-form expression in term of the number of contour poin ts foran upper bound on the number of operations required to execute the algorithm an illustrated example whichinvolves the construction of a minimum area surface describing a human head is included.cacm october 1977fuchs h.kedem,z m.uselton s p.surface reconstruction contour data serial sections,three-dimensional computer graphics minimum cost paths continuous tone displays5.25 5.32 8.2ca771001 jb december 27 1977 12:40 pm2925 5 29252925 5 29252925 5 2925
