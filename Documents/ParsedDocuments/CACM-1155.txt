experiments with a deductive question-answering programas an investigation in artificial intelligence,computer experiments on deductive question-answering were run with a lisp program called deducom an acronymfor deductive communicator when given 68 facts deducom answered 10 questions answerable from the facts a fact tells deducom either some specific information or a method of answering a general kind of question some conclusions drawn in the article are 1 deducom can answer a wide variety of questions 2)a human can increase the deductive power of deducom by telling it more facts 3 deducom can write verysimple programs it is hoped that this ability is the forerunner of an ability to self-program whichis a way to learn 4)deducom's search procedure at present has two bad defects some questions answerablefrom the given facts cannot be answered and some other answerable questions can be answered only ifthe relevant facts are given in the right order 6 at present deducom's method of making logical deductionsin predicate calculus has two bad defects some facts have to be changed to logically equivalent onesbefore being given to deducom and some redundant facts have to be given to deducom.cacm december 1965slagle j r.ca651214 jb march 6 1978 3:34 pm1155 4 11551456 4 11551468 4 11551515 4 11551699 4 11551856 4 11552127 4 11551155 5 11551155 5 11551155 5 11551324 5 11551515 5 11552096 5 11552127 5 11552210 5 11551155 6 11551155 6 11551155 6 11551155 6 11551324 6 11551324 6 11551487 6 11551527 6 11551781 6 11551856 6 1155
