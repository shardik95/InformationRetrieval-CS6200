a genealogy of control structuresthe issue of program control structures hashad a history of heated controversy to put this issue on a solid footing this paper reviews numerous theoreticalresults on control structures and explores their practical implications the classic result ofbohm and jacopini on the theoretical completeness of if-then-else and while-do is discussed several recentideas on control structures are then explored these include a review of various other control structures,results on time/space limitations and theorems relating the relative power of control structures undernotions of equivalence in conclusion the impact of theoretical results on the practicing programmer andthe importance of one-in one-out control structures as operational abstractions are discussed it is arguedfurther that there is insufficient evidence to warrant more than if-then-else while-do and their variants.cacm november 1975ledgard h f.marcotty m.structured programming control structures,goto statements language design pascal4.2 5.24ca751103 jb january 6 1978 9:53 am2319 4 27092411 4 27092480 4 27092574 4 27092594 4 27092709 4 27092709 4 27092709 4 27092709 4 27092709 4 27092802 4 27092889 4 27092937 4 27092939 4 27092972 4 27092989 4 27093004 4 27093004 4 27093005 4 27093025 4 27093101 4 27093121 4 27093155 4 27091425 5 27092138 5 27092204 5 27092456 5 27092477 5 27092709 5 27092709 5 27092709 5 27092821 5 27093121 5 27091312 6 2709308 6 2709309 6 27092456 6 27092709 6 27092709 6 2709
