a fast method for solving a class of tridiagonal linear systemsthe solution of linear systems having real symmetric,diagonally dominant,tridiagonal coefficient matrices with constant diagonals is considered it isproved that the diagonals of the lu decomposition converges when floating-point precision it is alsoproved that the computed lu decomposition converges when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limitsof the lu diagonals using floating point are roughly within machine precision of the limits usingreal arithmetic this fact is exploited to reduce the number of floating-point operations required tosolve a linear system from 8n-7 to 5n+2k-3 where k is much less than n the order of the matrix if theelements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals are 1 then only 4n+2k-3 operations are needed theentire lu decomposition takes k words of storage and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved upper and lower bounds on k are obtained in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonalconstants and parameters of the floating-point number system various generalizations of these results are discussed.cacm january 1974malcolm m a.palmer j.numerical linear algebra linear systems,toeplitz matrices tridiagonal matrices5 5.1 5.11 5.14 5.17ca740102 jb january 18 1978 2:50 pm2697 5 26972697 5 26972697 5 2697
