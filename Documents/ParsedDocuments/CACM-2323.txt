toward a general theory of special functionsa list of a number of natural developmentsfor the field of algebraic manipulation is given then the prospects for a general theory of functionsdefined by ordinary differential equations are discussed the claim is made that recent developmentsin mathematics indicate that it should be possible to algorithmically generate many properties of solutionsto differential equations such a theory is preferable to a less general effort to make algebraicmanipulation systems knowledgeable about the usual special functions e.g exponential hypergeometric)cacm july 1972moses j.algebraic manipulation special functions algebraicsimplification symbolic integration algebraic geometry differential algebra1.50 3.15 5.19 5.9ca720705 jb january 30 1978 3:07 pm2164 4 23232170 4 23232323 4 23232323 4 23232323 4 23232719 4 23232167 5 23232164 5 23232170 5 23232323 5 23232323 5 23232323 5 2323
