representation of contours ad regions for efficient computer searcha novel computer-searchable representationfor the three basic pictorial features contour maps region coverage and line structures is described the representation which has practical storage requirements provides a rapid mean of searching largefiles for data associated with geometric position as well as with attribute value an application of thisrepresentation to handling terrain information illustrates its utility the algebraic propertiesof the data structure make it computationally easy to determine whether a point lies within a closed boundary;compute the area contained by a closed boundary generate the closed boundary representing the union orintersection of two closed boundaries and determine the neighboring boundaries to a point and theminimum distances between them and the point.cacm february 1973merrill r d.contour map representation region boundary representation,computer-search-able structure graphic data retrieval graphic language two-dimensionalpatterns computer graphics graphic display3.21 3.23 3.79 6.35ca730201 jb january 24 1978 3:30 pm1630 4 25472287 4 25472547 4 25472547 4 25472987 4 25473062 4 25473165 4 25471326 5 25471925 5 25472547 5 25472547 5 25472547 5 25472987 5 25471326 6 25471630 6 25472125 6 25472547 6 25472633 6 2547421 6 2547524 6 2547
