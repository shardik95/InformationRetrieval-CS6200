an exponential method of numerical integrationof ordinary differential equationsa formula for numerical integration is prepared,which involves an exponential term this formula is compared to two standard integration methods,and it is shown that for a large class of differential equations the exponential formula has superior stabilityproperties for large step sizes thus this formula may be used with a large step size to decrease thetotal computing time for a solution significantly particularly in those engineering problems where high accuracy is not needed.cacm august 1963pope d a.ca630843 jb march 13 1978 7:52 pm2567 5 755755 5 755755 5 755755 5 7552268 6 755755 6 755
