computing standard deviations accuracyfour algorithms for the numerical computationof the standard deviation of unweighted sampled dataare analyzed two of the algorithms are well-known in the statisticaland computational literature the other two are new algorithmsspecifically intended for automatic computation our discussion is expository with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of"accuracy each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditionsunder which it will be accurate we conclude that all fouralgorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems but twoof the algorithms one new one old are substantially more accurateon difficult problems than are the other two.cacm september 1979chan t.lewis j.mean standard deviation least squares updatingestimates rounding error analysis condition number.5.5 5.11 5.19ca790907 db january 16 1980 4:23 pm1619 4 31662731 4 31663159 4 31663159 4 31663166 4 31663166 4 31663166 4 31663166 4 31663166 4 31663167 4 31663167 4 31661411 5 31662731 5 31662799 5 31663159 5 31663166 5 31663166 5 31663166 5 31663167 5 31662731 6 31662799 6 31663166 6 3166
