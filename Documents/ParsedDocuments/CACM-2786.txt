a system for typesetting mathematicsthis paper describes the design and implementationof a system for typesetting mathematics the language has been designed to be easy to learnand to use by people for example secretaries and mathematical typists who know neither mathematics nortypesetting experience indicates that the language can be learned in an hour or so for it has few rulesand fewer exceptions for typical expressions the size and font changes positioning line drawing andthe like necessary to print according to mathematical conventions are all done automatically for example,the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 2 produces formula the syntax of the language is specifiedby a small context-free grammar a compiler-compiler is used to make a compiler that translates this languageinto typesetting commands output maybe produced on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forwardand reverse half-line motions the system interfaces directly with text formatting programs somixtures of text and mathematics may be handled simply this paper was typeset by the authors using the system described cacm march 1975kernighan b w.cherry l l.typesetting photocomposition,compiler-compiler,graphics printing text processing.4.12 4.22 8.2ca750302 jb january 10 1978 8:56 am2626 4 27862786 4 27862840 4 27862919 4 27863017 4 27863110 4 27863174 4 27862629 5 27862733 5 27862746 5 27862786 5 27862786 5 27862786 5 27861665 6 27861739 6 27861781 6 27862139 6 27862179 6 27862423 6 27862545 6 27862786 6 27862786 6 2786799 6 2786
