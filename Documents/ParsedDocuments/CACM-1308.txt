a mathematical model for mechanical part descriptionthe flexibility of a mathematical model takesadvantage of the common information requirements of computer-aided engineering drawing numerical controltape generation and physical characteristic computation by judicious control of man-machine communicationrequirements improved results over conventional engineering design processes are possible an english-likeinput language tailored for use by draftsmen and designers will describe the part and specify theoutput desired one approach to the mathematical model consists of a group of surface-defining quadricequations which are created by a system of modular subprogram other subprograms will convert the mathematicalmodel into instructions for driving automatic drafting machines and numerical controlled machine tools physical part characteristics such as center of gravity can be computed by subprograms and used indynamic analysis work the proposed overall system is presented and experiments and demonstrations are discussed.cacm february 1965luh j y s.krolak r j.ca650216 jb march 7 1978 10:46 pm1308 5 13081308 5 13081308 5 1308
