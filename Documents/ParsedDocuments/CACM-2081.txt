some complete calculi for matricesa matrix calculus is introduced with the intention of developing data structuressuitable for a high level algorithmic language for mathematical programming the paper investigates how the special structure of matrices can be describedand utilized for efficient computing by saving memory space andsuperfluous operations sequences of matrices and sequences of sequencesof matrices are considered and matrix operators areextended to sequence operators and cumulative operators algorithmsare given which use symbol manipulation of matrix expressions soas to find the forms best suited for computation these forms arecalled normal forms several completeness results are obtainedin the sense that for each expression an equivalent expressionin normal form can be found within a specified calculus.cacm april 1970bayer r.witzgall c.complete calculus data structures linearprogramming matrix matrix concatenation,matrix sequences programming languages,sequence operations symbol manipulation4.12 4.22 5.14 5.41ca700403 jb february 13 1978 3:18 pm2081 5 20812081 5 20812081 5 20812253 5 20812254 5 20812081 6 20812081 6 2081437 6 2081
