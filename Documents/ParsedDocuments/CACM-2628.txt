minimal-total-processing time drum and disk scheduling disciplinesthis article investigates the application ofminimal-total-processing-time mtpt scheduling disciplines to rotating storage units when random arrivalof requests is allowed fixed-head drum and moving-head drum and moving-head disk storage units areconsidered and emphasis is placed on the relative merits of the mtpt scheduling discipline with respectto the shortest-latency-time-first sltf scheduling discipline the results of the simulation studiespresented show that neither scheduling discipline is unconditionally superior to the other for mostfixed-head drum applications the sltf discipline is preferable to mtpt but for intra-cylinder disk schedulingthe mtpt discipline offers a distinct advantage over the sltf discipline the computational requirementsof an algorithm that implements the mtpt scheduling discipline are shown to be comparable to sltf algorithms.in both cases the sorting procedure is the most time-consuming phase of the algorithm.cacm july 1974fuller s h.drum scheduling disk scheduling shortest-latency-time-first(sltf minimal-total-processing-time mtpt rotating storage units4.31 4.41 6.34 6.35ca740703 jb january 17 1978 1:07 pm2628 4 26282628 4 26282891 4 26283072 4 26283097 4 26282375 5 26282496 5 26282628 5 26282628 5 26282628 5 26282891 5 26282375 6 26282628 6 2628
