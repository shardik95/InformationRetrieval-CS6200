design of computer simulation experiments for industrial systemsthe aim of this paper is to provide backgroundinformation on the existing literature on experimental design techniques which may be applicable to the designof computer simulation experiments for industrial systems although major emphasis is placed on analysisof variance techniques three other techniques of data analysis are considered-multiple ranking procedures,sequential sampling and spectral analysis the paper treats four specific experimental designproblems and several techniques for solving them the four experimental design problems are 1 theproblem of stochastic convergence 2 the problem of factor selection 3 the problem of motiveand 4 the many response problem.cacm may 1966burdick d s.naylor t h.ca660502 jb march 3 1978 10:20 am1435 5 14351435 5 14351435 5 14351517 5 14351435 6 1435
