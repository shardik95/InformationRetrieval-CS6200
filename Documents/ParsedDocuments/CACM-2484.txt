a note on information organization and storagesince the logical structure of a data basecan be represented by a tree or graph it is quite natural for us to view the process of designing a database as that of constructing a tree or a graph a general method for constructing such a tree or a graphis provided there are three important elements in this general construction method namely a set ofbinary relations an algorithm for constructing subsets of a set and an algorithm for selecting anelement from the given set of objects the use of different relations and algorithms results in differentinformation structures as list tree ring etc thus the problem of information organization andstorage is reduced to that of defining relations and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints the results presented may be valuable to designers as useful design concepts and may serve asa basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.cacm july 1973huang j c.data base data-base management information retrieval,information structure file organization storage allocation tree graph3.70 3.73 3.74 5.32ca730702 jb january 23 1978 1:14 pm2484 5 24842484 5 24842484 5 2484
