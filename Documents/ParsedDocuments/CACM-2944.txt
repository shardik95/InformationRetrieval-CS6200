shifting garbage collection overhead to compile timethis paper discusses techniques which enable automaticstorage reclamation overhead to be partially shifted to compile time the paper assumes a transactionoriented collection scheme as proposed by deutsch and bobrow the necessary features of which aresummarized implementing the described optimizations requires global flow analysis to be performed on thesource program it is shown that at compile time certain program actions that affect the reference countsof cells can be deduced this information is used to find actions that cancel when the code is executedand those that can be grouped to achieve improved efficiency.cacm july 1977barth j m.garbage collection global flow analysis list processing,optimization reference counts storage management3.80 4.12 4.20 4.34ca770708 jb december 28 1977 8:38 am2855 4 29442855 4 29442944 4 29442944 4 29443106 4 29443112 4 29442833 5 29442944 5 29442944 5 29442944 5 29442998 5 2944
