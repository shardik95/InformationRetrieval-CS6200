beyond programming languagesas computer technology matures our growing ability to create large systems is leading to basic changes in the nature of programming current programming language concepts will not be adequate for building and maintainingsystems of the complexity called for by the tasks we attempt justas high level languages enabled the programmer to escape from theintricacies of a machine's order code higher level programming systemscan provide the means to understand and manipulate complexsystems and components in order to develop such systems we needto shift our attention away from the detailed specification ofalgorithms towards the description of the properties of the packagesand objects with which we build this paper analyzes some of theshortcomings of programming languages as they now exist,and lays out some possible directions for future research.cacm july 1979winograd t.programming programming languages programming systems systems development4.0 4.20 4.22 4.40ca790701 dh august 22 1979 2:00 pm2155 4 31502294 4 31502558 4 31502837 4 31502842 4 31502945 4 31503031 4 31503077 4 31503105 4 31503148 4 31503148 4 31503150 4 31503150 4 31503150 4 31503150 4 31503150 4 31503150 4 31503150 4 31503150 4 31503150 4 31503155 4 31502060 5 31502704 5 31502842 5 31502939 5 31502941 5 31502943 5 31502940 5 31503073 5 31503148 5 31503150 5 31503150 5 31503150 5 3150
