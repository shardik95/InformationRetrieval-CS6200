some theorems to aid in solving the file allocation problemthe file allocation problem-i.e the problemof finding the optimal set of network sites at which to locate copies of a file-is known to be in general,polynomial complete heuristics and other aids to finding optimal or near-optimal solutions aretherefore much needed in this paper we present three theorems which can be applied a priori to indicatethat certain sites should or should not be included in an optimal allocation.cacm november 1977grapa e.belford g g.file allocation computer networks distributed data management4.33ca771116 jb december 27 1977 8:45 am2900 5 29002900 5 29002900 5 2900
