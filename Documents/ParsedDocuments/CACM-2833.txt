an efficient incremental automatic garbage collectorthis paper describes a new way of solvingthe storage reclamation problem for a system such as lisp that allocates storage automatically from aheap and does not require the programmer to give any indication that particular items are no longer usefulor accessible a reference count scheme for reclaiming non-self-referential structures and a linearizing,compacting copying scheme to reorganize all storage at the users discretion are proposed thealgorithms are designed to work well in systems which use multiple levels of storage and large virtualaddress space they depend on the fact that most cells are referenced exactly once and that referencecounts need only be accurate when storage is about to be reclaimed a transaction file stores changesto reference counts and a multiple reference table stores the count for items which are referenced more than once.cacm september 1976deutsch l p.bobrow d g.storage management garbage collection lisp4.19ca760906 jb january 4 1978 8:58 am1708 4 28331781 4 28331826 4 28331860 4 28331972 4 28332156 4 28332156 4 28332168 4 28332168 4 28332249 4 28332314 4 28332438 4 28332719 4 28332723 4 28332736 4 28332736 4 28332833 4 28332833 4 28332833 4 28332845 4 28332855 4 28333074 4 28333112 4 28333112 4 28331626 5 28331826 5 28332736 5 28332833 5 28332833 5 28332833 5 28332855 5 28332944 5 28333112 5 2833106 6 28331380 6 28331549 6 28331826 6 28331826 6 2833210 6 28331972 6 28331972 6 28332438 6 28332513 6 28332723 6 28332736 6 28332766 6 28332833 6 28332833 6 28332833 6 28332838 6 28332998 6 28332998 6 2833731 6 2833
