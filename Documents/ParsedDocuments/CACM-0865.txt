internal and tape sorting using the replacement-selection techniquea general technique for sequencing unsortedrecords is presented the technique is shown to be applicable for the first stage of a generalized sortprogram the formation of initial strings as well as for sorting records within a memory storage aninternal sort it is shown that given n records in memory storage records are sequenced using 1+log2n tests per record that initial string lengths will average 2n for random input records and that reading,writing and processing can be accomplished simultaneously if the computer permits such overlap.cacm may 1963goetz m a.ca630502 jb march 14 1978 11:36 am1919 4 865852 4 865864 4 865865 4 8652017 5 86574 5 865851 5 865865 5 865865 5 865865 5 865849 6 865850 6 865851 6 865852 6 865853 6 865854 6 865855 6 865856 6 865857 6 865858 6 865858 6 865859 6 865860 6 865861 6 865862 6 865863 6 865864 6 865865 6 865865 6 865866 6 865
