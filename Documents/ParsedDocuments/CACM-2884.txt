permutation enumeration four new permutation algorithmsclassical permutation enumeration algorithms encounterspecial cases requiring additional computation every nth permutation when generating the n permutationson n marks four new algorithms have the attribute that special cases occur every n(n-1)permutations two of the algorithms produce the next permutation with a single exchange of two marks the other two algorithmsinfrequently exchange more than two marks but the rules for generating the next permutation arevery simple performance tests which have counted execution of assignment statements comparisons arithmeticoperations and subscripted array references have shown superiority of the new algorithms compared toboothroyd's implementation of m b well's algorithm and ehrlich's implementation of the johnson-trotter algorithm.cacm february 1976ives f m.permutations loop-free algorithms5.30ca760203 jb january 5 1978 9:33 am2834 4 28842884 4 28843115 4 28842417 5 28842884 5 28842884 5 28842884 5 28842908 5 28843115 5 2884907 6 28842045 6 28842417 6 28842466 6 28842505 6 28842884 6 28842884 6 2884521 6 2884579 6 2884785 6 2884
