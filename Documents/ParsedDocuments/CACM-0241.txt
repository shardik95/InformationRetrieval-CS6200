machine calculation of moments of a probability distributiona method is presented for the calculation on amachine of the moments of a probability distribution necessitating little more than n additions and n referencesto memory for each moment instead of the minimum of n multiplication 2n additions and 2n referencesto memory required by the most straightforward method where n is the number of entries in the probabilitydistribution the method is directly applicable when a tabulated distribution exists as when it hasbeen computed by repeated convolution but in this case it conserves both time and accuracy.cacm december 1961lechner j a.ca611209 jb march 15 1978 10:15 pm241 5 241241 5 241241 5 241
