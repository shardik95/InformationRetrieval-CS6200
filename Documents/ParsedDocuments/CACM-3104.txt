test data as an aid in proving program correctnessproofs of program correctness tend to be longand tedious whereas testing though useful in detecting errors usually does not guarantee correctness this paper introduces a techniques whereby test data can be used in proving program correctness in addition to simplifying the process of proving correctness this method simplifies the process of providingaccurate specification for a program the applicability of this technique to proceduresand recursive programs is demonstrated.cacm may 1978geller m.program verification program testing recursive programs4.22 4.6 5.24ca780503 dh february 26 1979 2:10 pm2874 4 31042981 4 31043030 4 31043077 4 31043104 4 31043104 4 31042457 5 31042683 5 31043104 5 31043104 5 31043104 5 31043170 5 31043055 6 31043104 6 3104
