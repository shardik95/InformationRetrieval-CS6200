a methodology for calculating andoptimizing real-time system performancethe continually increasing size complexity,number of types and cost of data processing systems are causing serious re-examination within governmentand industry of the criteria for and methods of calculating and optimizing data processing system costand performance real-time data processing systems as typified by the automated airline reservation systemare discussed in this paper criteria for evaluating performance are described a methodology for calculatingand optimizing is outlined and the method is illustrated by carrying out a portion of the performancecalculation and the optimization of a drum-oriented message switching system.cacm july 1968stimler s.brons k a.real-time system analysis real-time system design,real-time system performance criteria real-time system cost performance ratio3.27 3.80 3.81 3.89 6.9ca680710 jb february 22 1978 11:40 am1719 5 17191719 5 17191719 5 17192319 5 17191408 6 17191719 6 17191749 6 17191751 6 17192016 6 17192017 6 17192080 6 17192188 6 17192203 6 17192204 6 1719
