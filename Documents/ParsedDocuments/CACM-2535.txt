the effects of multiplexing on a computer-communications systema study is made of the way in which asynchronoustime division multiplexing changes the stochastic nature of the arrival process from a user to the computerand consequently affects the performance of a time-shared computer-communications system it isconcluded that while for certain values of system parameters there is noticeable improvement in theperformance of the computer model in the sense that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced theseimprovements are offset by the transmission delays imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little orno change in the computer-communications system performance analytical and simulation results arebased on the model of the computer-communications system being an m/d/1 queue the multiplexor in tandemwith a single exponential server the computer analytical results include a general description of theoutput process of an m/d/1 queue and the conditions under which this output process is approximately poisson.cacm march 1973pack c d.computer communications time-sharing multiplexing,scheduling algorithms operating systems3.80 3.81 6.20ca730304 jb january 24 1978 11:13 am2535 5 25352535 5 25352535 5 2535
