synthesizing constraint expressionsa constraint network representation is presentedfor a combinatorial search problem finding values for a set of variables subject to a set of constraints a theory of consistency levels in such networks is formulated which is related to problemsof backtrack tree search efficiency an algorithm is developed that can achieve any level of consistencydesired in order to preprocess the problem for subsequent backtrack search or to function as an alternativeto backtrack search by explicitly determining all solutions.cacm november 1978freuder e.backtrack combinatorial algorithms constraintnetworks constraint satisfaction graph coloring network consistency relaxation scene labeling search3.63 3.64 5.25 5.30 5.32ca781111 dh january 22 1979 3:43 pm1504 4 30403040 4 30401145 5 30403040 5 30403040 5 30403040 5 3040
