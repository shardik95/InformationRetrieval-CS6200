amesplot-a higher level data plotting software systemamesplot is an extensible software system designed to make the display of data as simple painless and neat as possible the system described is hardware-independent and has been implemented on a variety of installations,of different manufacturers having diverse configurations the elements common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these elements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated.these modules are specified independently and are independent of the axissystems or other attributes of the plot this enables plots of anycomplexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules thebasic syntax of amesplot is outlined and a brief description is givenof its current utility software consisting of macros to produceself-scaled plots formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots,map coastlines and 3-d plots the system was formulated in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information,and it should be fully integrable with user's program writtenin most conventional higher languages the functions of positioning,locating and scaling in the layout of multiple subplots ofaxes labels and all other elements of the plot are handled automaticallyby the software system unless the user specifies otherwise the structuring of plots from multiple independent self-contained subplots is described.transformation projection scaling rotation or shifting of entire plots or subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible the user may interact freely with amesplot at three levels enabling him to construct his own data markers alphabetic characters and transformations andto produce a variety of artistic and other effects.cacm september 1970hirschsoln i.computer graphics data potting data displaysyntax hardware independent software,display device independent software plot elements self-scaled plots,user interaction tablet organization map display projection4.13 4.29 4.49 4.9ca700903 jb february 10 1978 2:08 pm2003 4 20022002 4 20022002 4 20022152 4 20021767 5 20021937 5 20022002 5 20022002 5 20022002 5 2002
