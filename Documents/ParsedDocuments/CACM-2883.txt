an application of heuristic search methods to edge and contour detectionthis paper presents a method for detecting edgesand contours in noisy pictures the properties of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edgedetection problem becomes the problem of minimizing the given figure of merit this problem can be representedas a shortest path problem on a graph and can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms the relations between this representation of the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approachare discussed showing that the graph search method can lead to substantial improvements in computingtime moreover if heuristic search methods are used the computing time will depend on the amountof noise in the picture some experimental results are given these show how various information about theshape of the contour of an object can be embeddedin the figure of merit thus allowing the extractionof contours from noisy picture and the separation of touching objects.cacm february 1976martelli a.picture processing pattern recognition edgedetection contour detection contour following optimization problems dynamic programming shortestpath heuristic search methods problem solving methods3.63 3.64 3.66 5.42ca760204 jb january 5 1978 9:30 am2883 4 28832195 5 28832883 5 28832883 5 28832883 5 2883
