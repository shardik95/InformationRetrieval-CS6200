social processes and proofs of theorems and programsit is argued that formal verifications ofprograms no matter how obtained will not play thesame key role in the development of computer science and softwareengineering as proofs do in mathematics furthermore the absenceof continuity the inevitability of change and the complexity ofspecification of significantly many real programs make the formal verification process difficult to justify and manage it is feltthat ease of formal verification should not dominate programlanguage design.cacm may 1979de millo r.lipton r.perlis a.formal mathematics mathematical proofs,program verification program specification2.10 4.6 5.24ca790501 dh june 5 1979 2:23 pm3140 5 31403140 5 31403140 5 31403178 5 31403076 6 31403140 6 31403142 6 31403179 6 31403180 6 31403181 6 31403182 6 3140
