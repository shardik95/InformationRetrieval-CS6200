an interactive command generating facilitya facility to permit conversationally controlled tasksto be executed in a noninteractive environment is proposed.a means by which programs can generate interactive time-sharing commandsand receive the corresponding output response is presented the commands will be invoked as if they had been typed at a console keyboard it is argued that this facility will help overcome some of the current limitations in man-computer communication a set of functions to accomplish the above which could be embedded into any string processing language is suggested and necessary information pertinent to implementation of the facility on existing time-sharing systems is given.cacm july 1970grant c a.time-sharing command languages pseudo-teletype interaction,conditional job control operating systems3.80 3.81 4.29 4.39ca700701 jb february 13 1978 9:43 am1530 4 20361531 4 20361565 4 20361703 4 20361945 4 20362036 4 20361455 5 20362036 5 20362036 5 20362036 5 2036
