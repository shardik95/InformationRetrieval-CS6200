rapid computation of general interpolationformulas and mechanical quadrature ruleslet f have n continuous on a closed interval[a,b and let l be a linear functional the attempt is made to approximate l f with l q where q is a polynomial,approximating f algorithms are developed for rapid computation of l q for a wide class ofselections of q which includes the lagrangian and hermitian rules as special cases.cacm december 1971gustafson s.linear functionals divided differences newton's interpolation formula5.13 5.16ca711208 jb february 2 1978 9:49 am2135 4 21352135 4 21352131 5 21352135 5 21352135 5 21352135 5 21352132 5 21352135 6 21352135 6 2135
