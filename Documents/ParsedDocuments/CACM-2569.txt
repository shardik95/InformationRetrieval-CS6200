computer generation of gamma random variateswith non-integral shape parameterswhen the shape parameter a is integral,generating gamma random variables with a digital computer is straightforward there is no simple methodfor generating gamma random variates with non-integral shape parameters a common procedure is to approximatelygenerate such random variables by use of the so-called probability switch method another procedure,which is exact is due to johnk this paper presents a rejection method for exactly generatinggamma random variables when a is greater than 1 the efficiency of the rejection method is shown tobe better than the efficiency of johnk's method the paper concludes that when a is non-integral the followingmix of procedures yields the best combination of accuracy and efficiency 1 when a is less than1 use johnk's method 2 when 1 is less than a and a is less than 5 use the rejection method 3 whena is greater than 5 use the probability switch method.cacm december,1974wallace n d.simulation gamma random variables,probability distribution random numbers5.5 8.1ca741205 jb january 16 1978 9:35 am2569 5 25692569 5 25692569 5 25692847 5 25692928 5 25693046 5 25693098 5 25693107 5 25691751 6 25692277 6 25692380 6 25692522 6 25692569 6 25692569 6 25692569 6 25692569 6 25692569 6 25692847 6 25692847 6 25693098 6 2569
