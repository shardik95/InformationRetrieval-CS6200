a modular computer sharing systeman alternative approach to the design and organizationof a general purpose interactive multiterminal computing system is presented the system organization describedis a conceptually simple arrangement of a bank of interchangeable computers each of whichis a memory/processor pair that are assigned to process terminal jobs as they arrive one of the computersserves as the master or control computer and supervises the collection and distribution of messagesfrom and to the remote terminals in the simplest form there is a disk drive for each connectedterminal a crosspoint switching network allows any such disk drive to be connected to any computer thus while each active terminal user occupies a dedicated disk drive he may share the computer withmany other terminal users in a simple manner the ratio of users to computers is dependent on boththe size and power of the machines used and the computation requirements of the particular mix of users this system organization is inherently a simpler and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computersand has the potential of a highly available system at relatively low cost economic configurationsare possible for a range of systems sizes that span at least one order of magnitude finally problemprograms developed by remote terminal users can be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.cacm october 1969baskin h b.horowitz e b.tennison r d.rittenhouse l e.multiple terminal systems terminal oriented systems,multiple processor systems high availability conversational systems general purpose time-sharing systems,real-time response system modular constructed systems modular computer-sharing systems graphics,file switch intercomputer communications control computer problem computer roll-in roll-out6.21ca691002 jb february 15 1978 3:52 pm1844 5 18441844 5 18441844 5 1844
