decomposability instabilities andsaturation in multiprogramming systemsa step-by-step approach to model the dynamicbehavior and evaluate the performance of computing systems is proposed it is based on a technique of variableaggregation and the concept of nearly decomposable system both borrowed from econometrics this approachis taken in order to identify in multiprogramming paging systems i unstable regimes of operations and ii)critical computing loads which bring the system into states of saturation this analysis leads to amore complete definition of the circumstances in which thrashing can set in.cacm july 1975courtois p j.multiprogramming paging performance evaluation,saturation instabilities thrashing aggregation system levels hierarchy,networks of queues4.31 4.32 8.1 8.2ca750701 jb january 9 1978 10:39 am1828 4 27411854 4 27411877 4 27411892 4 27411960 4 27412068 4 27412150 4 27412317 4 27412319 4 27412377 4 27412342 4 27412376 4 27412379 4 27412424 4 27412482 4 27412618 4 27412632 4 27412704 4 27412712 4 27412723 4 27412738 4 27412740 4 27412741 4 27412741 4 27412741 4 27412867 4 27413070 4 27413184 4 27411526 5 27411749 5 27412454 5 27412741 5 27412741 5 27412741 5 27413016 5 27413070 5 27413153 5 27411805 6 27411901 6 27412454 6 27412741 6 27412741 6 27412741 6 27412891 6 27412988 6 2741
