sorting on a mesh-connected parallel computertwo algorithms are presented for sorting n^2elements on an n x n mesh-connected processor array that require o(n routing and comparison steps the best previous algorithm takes time o(n log n the algorithms of this paper are shown to be optimalin time within small constant factors extensions to higher-dimensional arrays are also given.cacm april 1977thompson c d.kung h t.parallel computer parallel sorting parallel merge,routing and comparison steps perfect shuffle processor in terconnection pattern4.32 5.25 5.31ca770409 jb december 29 1977 4:58 am2973 5 29732973 5 29732973 5 29733156 5 29732289 6 29732973 6 29733075 6 2973
