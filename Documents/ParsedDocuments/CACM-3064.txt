event manipulation for discrete simulationsrequiring large numbers of eventsthe event-manipulation system presented here consists oftwo major parts the first part addresses the familiar problem of event scheduling efficiencywhen the number of scheduled events grows large the second part deals with the less apparent problemof providing efficiency and flexibility as scheduled events are accessed to be executed additional featuresand problems dealt with include the proper handling of simultaneous events that certain events must be created,scheduled and executed at the same points in simulated time that infinite loops caused by the concatenationof such zero-time events are possible and must be diagnosed that maintaining various eventcounts is practical and economical and that a capability for handling time-displaceable events is desirable and possible cacm september 1978ulrich e.simulation discrete systems simulation discreteevent simulation time-flow mechanisms3.65 3.74 4.22 8.1ca780908 dh january 29 1979 6:46 pm2767 4 30642844 4 30642844 4 30642936 4 30642936 4 30643051 4 30643064 4 30643064 4 30643064 4 30643064 4 30643064 4 30643109 4 30641846 5 30641939 5 30642742 5 30642767 5 30642936 5 30643064 5 30643064 5 30643064 5 3064
