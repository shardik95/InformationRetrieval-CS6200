pattern width at a given anglethat the pattern feature width as a functionof angle possesses several possible interpretations is demonstrated in this paper which is a review ofthe width concept in pattern recognition and the geometrical concept itself the object of the workis to clarify how the word description can be made precise so that computer algorithms for feature extractionmay be obtained the focus is on the theoretical subject matter the results consist of a set-theoreticdefinition of width-at-angle a theorem relating it to the pattern boundary radius vector and descriptionsof alternate widths all widths are calculated for an illustrative example graphical and tabular comparisonsare given substantial variation in width-at-angle magnitude is found the principal conclusion is thatthe set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern feature when it can be easily computed further investigationof the information contained in only part of a width function is recommended for cases wherecomputation of width-at-angle is difficult.cacm january 1971klinger a.feature extraction pattern recognition,figureproperties picture processing integral geometry width-at-angle extent integral projections,linear pattern measures width functions3.60 3.62 3.63 5.12ca710102 jb february 8 1978 12:49 pm2232 5 22322232 5 22322232 5 2232
