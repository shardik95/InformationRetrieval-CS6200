efficient algorithms for graph manipulation h algorithm a447)efficient algorithms are presented for partitioninga graph into connected components biconnected components and simple paths the algorithm for partitioningof a graph into simple paths is iterative and each iteration produces a new path between twovertices already on paths the start vertex can be specified dynamically if v is the number of verticesand e is the number of edges each algorithm requires time and space proportional to max v,e)when executed on a random access computer.cacm june 1973hopcroft j.tarjan r.graphs,analysis of algorithms graph manipulation5.32ca730610 jb january 23 1978 1:55 pm2490 4 24902177 5 24902490 5 24902490 5 24902490 5 2490
