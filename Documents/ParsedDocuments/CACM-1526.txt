multiprogramming under a page on demand strategya model of multiprogramming for a particularcomputer system using a page on demand strategy is developed analysis of this model is used to predictperformance measured by the average usage of the cpu when user programs are typical of those arisingfrom an interactive time sharing environment the effect of several hardware modifications is alsoanalyzed a parameter readily calculated from the hardware characteristics and the program statistics,is proposed for gauging the effect of multiprogramming.cacm october 1967smith j l.ca671007 jb february 27 1978 2:07 pm1526 5 15261526 5 15261526 5 15261892 5 15262068 5 15262741 5 15261526 6 15261526 6 15261526 6 15261572 6 15261728 6 15261749 6 15261751 6 15261752 6 15262454 6 1526
