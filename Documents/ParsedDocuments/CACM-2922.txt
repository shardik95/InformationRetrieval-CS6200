two-level control structure for nondeterministic programmingthe basic ideas of nondeterministic programmingare critically reconsidered to single out a proper attitude and programming style for language allowingdirect control of nondeterministic features the proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity ofthe nondeterministic formulation of search processes on one level the attempt level deferring the coordinationof problem solving efforts to another the choice level the feasibility of recognizing these twolevels is discussed stressing that the structure to be managed at the choice level is a free of contexts the leaves are computational environments each holding an alternative under inspection whilethe other nodes are associated with choice poin ts according to the proposed programming style a generativefunction is associated with each choice poin t which expresses the desired choice strategy the mainadvantage on this approach is the localization of the search strategies each nonterminal node of thetree keeps track of the state of the computation as it was when the choice poin t was last interrogated,holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate the available alternatives examples are given interm of nd-lisp an extension of lisp designed and implemented according to these guidelines.cacm october 1977montangero c.pacini g.turini f.nondeterministic programming artificial in telligence,control structures backtracking search strategy planning context tree3.64 4.22ca771004 jb december 27 1977 11:30 am2625 4 29222922 4 29223081 4 29223101 4 29223112 4 29222438 5 29222922 5 29222922 5 29222922 5 2922
