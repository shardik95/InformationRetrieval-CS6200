an algorithm for solving a special classof tridiagonal systems of linear equationsan algorithm is presented for solving a systemof linear equation bu=k where b is tridiagonal and of a special form it is shown that this algorithmis almost twice as fast as the gaussian elimination method usually suggested for solving such systems in addition explicit formulas for the inverse and determinant of the matrix b are given.cacm april 1969rose d j.tridiagonal gaussian elimination central difference5.14 5.17ca690407 jb february 17 1978 4:18 pm1910 5 19101910 5 19101910 5 1910
