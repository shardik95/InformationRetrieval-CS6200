on a class of iteration formulas and some historical notesthe class of iteration formulas obtainableby rational approximations of euler's formula is derived with the corresponding error estimates some historical notes on iterative procedures are followed by a derivation of euler's formula with theassociated error estimate in a new notation which simplifies the error estimate and suggests generalizations the final section considers the pade approximants to the euler polynomial and shows how a number of knownformulas may be derived from this unified approach there is a short discussion of the best formula.cacm june 1961traub j f.ca610606 jb march 16 1978 10:36 pm319 4 319319 5 319319 5 319319 5 319380 5 319
