a comparison of the primal-simplex and primal-dualalgorithms for linear programminga statistical comparison of the primal-dualand the more commonly used primal-simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems has been made underthe assumption of starting with a full artificial basis under these conditions the primal-dual methodshows a statistically significant superiority on randomly generated problems it has also been found viaa regression analysis that the relevant parameters in determining the difference in the number of iterationsbetween the algorithms is not only the number of constraints and the number of variables butalso the ratio of the latter to the former.cacm november 1965mueller r k.cooper l.ca651110 jb march 6 1978 4:50 pm1171 5 11711171 5 11711171 5 1171
