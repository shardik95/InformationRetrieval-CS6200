a controlled experiment in program testingand code walkthroughs/inspectionsthis paper describes an experiment in programtesting employing 59 highly experienced data processing professionals using seven methods to testa small pl/i program the results show that the popular code walk through/inspection method was as effectiveas other computer-based methods in finding errors and that the most effective methods in terms oferrors found and cost employed pairs of subjects who tested the program independently and then pooledtheir findings the study also shows that there is a tremendous amount of variability among subjectsand that the ability to detect certain types of errors varies from method to method.cacm september 1978myers g.software reliability program verification debugging,testing code walkthroughs code inspections personnel selection4.6ca780906 dh february 5 1979 10:47 am3066 5 30663066 5 30663066 5 3066
