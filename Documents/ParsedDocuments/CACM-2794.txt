state-space problem-reduction and theorem proving-some relationshipsthis paper suggests a bidirectional relationshipbetween state-space and problem-reduction representations it presents a formalism based on multiple-inputand multiple-output operators which provides a basis for viewing the two types of representationsin this manner a representation of the language recognition problem which is based on the cockeparsing algorithm is used as an illustration a method for representing problems in first-order logicin such a way that the inference system employed by a resolution-based theorem prover determines whetherthe set of clauses is interpreted in the state-spacer mode or in the problem-reduction mode is presented the analogous concepts in problem-reduction and theorem proving and the terminology used to refer to them,are noted the relationship between problem-reduction input resolution and linear resolution is discussed.cacm february 1975vanderbrug g j.minker j.artificial intelligence state-space representation,problem-reduction representation theorem proving language recognition3.64ca750205 jb january 12 1978 8:27 am2794 5 27942794 5 27942794 5 2794
