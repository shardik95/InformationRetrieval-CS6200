algebraic simplification a guide for the perplexedalgebraic simplification is examined first fromthe point of view of a user who needs to comprehend a large expression and second from the point of viewof a designer who wants to construct a useful and efficient system first we describe various techniquesakin to substitution these techniques can be used to decrease thesize of an expression and make itmore intelligible to a user then we delineate the spectrum of approaches to the design of automatic simplificationcapabilities in an algebraic manipulation system systems are divided into five types each typeprovides different facilities for the manipulation and simplification of expressions finally we discusssome of the theoretical results related to algebraic simplification we describe several positive resultsabout the existence of powerful simplification algorithms and the number-theoretic conjectures on whichthey rely results about the nonexistence of algorithms for certain classes of expressions are included.cacm august 1971moses j.algebraic manipulation algebraic simplification,canonical simplification3.1 3.2 3.6 4.9 5.2 5.9ca710805 jb february 2 1978 3:42 pm1396 4 21671396 4 21671946 4 21672167 4 21672167 4 21672167 4 21672167 4 21672857 4 21672956 4 21671379 5 21671393 5 21671392 5 21672167 5 21672167 5 21672167 5 21672164 5 21672169 5 21672170 5 21672323 5 21672719 5 21671626 6 2167210 6 21672151 6 21672164 6 21672165 6 21672167 6 21672167 6 21672167 6 21672167 6 21672166 6 21672170 6 21672210 6 21672645 6 21672657 6 2167
