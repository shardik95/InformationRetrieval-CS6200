an interrupt based organization for management information systemsa programming structure language constructs and a supervisory system organization are proposedfor the design and coding of large shared data base systems thebases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structureand the newly introduced concept of file tagging which is theprocess of associating program structures and interrupt generatingconditions with items in the data base an algorithm for resolvingconflicts which arise in scheduling the interrupt processing routinesis presented dpl a programming language and supervisorysystem in which these concepts are implemented is used to illustratedthe new organization which is proposed for management information systems.cacm december 1970morgan h l.management information systems integrated data processing,supervisors interrupts monitoring systems supervisorysystems interrupt scheduling parallel processing3.51 4.22 4.32ca701204 jb february 9 1978 3:46 pm1959 4 19591135 5 19591959 5 19591959 5 19591959 5 19592182 5 19592534 5 1959830 6 19591787 6 19591959 6 19591959 6 19591973 6 19592111 6 19592182 6 1959799 6 1959
