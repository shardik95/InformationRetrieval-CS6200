performance of rollback recovery systems under intermittent failuresa mathematical model of a transaction-orientedsystem under intermittent failures is proposed the system is assumed to operate with a checkpointingand rollback/recovery method to ensure reliable information processing the model is used to derive theprincipal performance measures including availability response time and the system saturation point cacm june 1978gelenbe e.derochette d.database reliability file systems checkpoints recoveryprocedures checking techniques reliability and system performance evaluation3.72 3.73 4.33 4.35 4.6 5.5 8.1ca780608 dh february 9 1979 10:26 am3089 4 30892599 5 30893089 5 30893089 5 30893089 5 3089
