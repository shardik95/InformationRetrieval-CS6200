optimum tape-writing proceduresconsider a magnetic tape system with a readcheck after writing where an error occurs in writing a record a programmed error routine may eitherbypass some or all of the area on tape or try to rewrite the record on the same area this paper evaluatesthese two procedures on the basis of expected loss of computer time and develops a decision rule forselecting the optimum procedure the rule depends critically on the number of times the tape being writtenwill be used in the future in the case where the optimum procedure is to bypass an area a seconddecision-the size of the area to be bypassed-is necessary a formula is developed to determine theoptimum area to be bypassed for each procedure.cacm september 1961hutchinson k.ca610912 jb march 16 1978 1:32 pm282 5 282282 5 282282 5 282
