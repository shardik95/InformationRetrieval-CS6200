plotting a function of three independent variablesa method is developed for constructing an approximateplot of a function of three independent variables the plot is similar to a conventional contourmap except that there are three scales to represent the independent variables scale values of the threeindependent variables are added vectorially and the value of the function is then read fromthe values associated with nearby contours.cacm july,1967stineman r w.ca670705 jb february 28 1978 8:59 am1568 5 15681568 5 15681568 5 1568
