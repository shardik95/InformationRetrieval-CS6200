covering edges by cliques with regard tokeyword conflicts and intersection graphskellerman has presented a method for determiningkeyword conflicts and described a heuristic algorithm which solves a certain combinatorial optimizationproblem in connection with this method this optimization problem is here shown to be equivalentto the problem of covering the edges of a graph by complete subgraphs with the objective of minimizingthe number of complete subgraphs a relationship between this edge-clique-cover problem and the graph coloringproblem is established which allows algorithms for either one of these problems to be constructedfrom algorithm for the other as consequences of this relationship the keyword conflict problem and theedge-clique-cover problem are shown to be np-complete and if p=np then they do not admit polynomial-time approximationalgorithms which always produce solutions within a factor less than 2 from the optimum.cacm february 1978kou l.stockmeyer l.wong c.watson t.keyword conflicts intersection graphs node cliquecover edge clique cover computational complexity np-complete problems polynomial-time heuristics4.12 5.25 5.32ca780205 jb march 28 1978 4:18 pm3018 5 30183018 5 30183018 5 3018
