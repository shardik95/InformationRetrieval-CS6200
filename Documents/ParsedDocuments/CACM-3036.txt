the selection of optimal tab settingsa new generation of computer terminals allowstab settings to be selected and set by the computer this feature can be used to reduce the number of charactersthat are needed to represent a document for transmission and printing in this note an algorithmis given for selecting the optimal set of tab stops for minimizing the number of characters transmitted an implementation of the algorithm has reduced the number of characters transmitted by from7 to 30 percent but requires a prepass through the document to compute a matrix used in determiningthe optimal set tab stops the use of fixed tab stops as a heuristic alternative can achieveabout 80 percent of optimal with no prepass cacm december 1978peterson j.bitner j.howard j.tabs word processing dynamic programming3.9 4.4ca781203 dh january 18 1979 4:34 pm 3036 5 30363036 5 30363036 5 3036
