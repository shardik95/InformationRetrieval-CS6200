parallel numerical methods for the solution of equationsclassical iterative procedures for the numericalsolution of equations provide at each stage a single new approximation to the root in question atechnique is given for the development of numerical procedures which provide at each stage several approximationsto a solution of an equation the s8everal approximations obtained in any iteration are computationallyindependent making the methods of interest in a parallel processing environment convergence isinsured by extracting the best information at each iteration several families of numerical procedureswhich use the technique of the procedures in a parallel processing environment are developed and measurementsof these statistics are reported these measurements are interpreted in a parallel processingenvironment in such an environment the procedures obtained are superior to standard algorithms.cacm may 1967shedler g s.ca670505 jb february 28 1978 10:44 am1601 5 16011601 5 16011601 5 16011781 5 1601123 6 1601196 6 1601919 6 1601990 6 16011007 6 16011046 6 16011131 6 16011139 6 16011140 6 16011149 6 16011198 6 16011215 6 16011223 6 16011265 6 16011303 6 16011323 6 16011358 6 16011366 6 16011421 6 16011460 6 16011462 6 16011463 6 16011467 6 16011468 6 16011477 6 16011491 6 16011496 6 16011531 6 16011535 6 16011565 6 16011601 6 16011602 6 16011613 6 16011614 6 16011626 6 16011641 6 16011787 6 16011788 6 1601205 6 1601224 6 1601249 6 1601288 6 1601316 6 1601381 6 1601398 6 160111 6 1601404 6 1601410 6 1601463 6 1601464 6 1601483 6 16013184 6 16013188 6 1601584 6 1601600 6 1601680 6 1601691 6 1601763 6 1601799 6 1601
