eigenvectors of a 2n x 2n matrixit has been known that the eigenvalues of acertain 2n x 2n matrix can be obtained by use of two smaller matrices of order n which can be easilyconstructed an algorithm is given to obtain the eigenvectors of the 2n x 2n matrix by use ofthe eigenvectors of the smaller matrices.cacm december 1967charmonman s.ca671207 jb february 26 1978 2:22 pm1501 5 15011501 5 15011501 5 1501
