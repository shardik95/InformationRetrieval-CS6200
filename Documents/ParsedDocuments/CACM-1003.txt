a computer analysis method for thermal diffusion in biochemical systemsin the thermal detection of rapid biochemicalreactions it is necessary to correct the temperature data for transient heat conduction losses in a cylindricalcalorimeter to handle the complexities arising from varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulatinglayers a computer program was developed which gives the temperature distribution of the systemas a function of radius and time this distribution is corrected at each step by a subroutine which calculatesthe instantaneous chemical state of there action as well as the heat produced by this reaction the program is based on a direct statement of fourier's law of heat conduction and the chemical rateequation to provide a bookkeeping law to follow the reactants and the flow of heat packets in such away that the computer continually stores the heat distribution a computer analysis method is here regardedas one in which the physical laws of a process are used explicitly in the program usually this resultsin by passing much of the mathematical procedures conventionally used the program was tested againstsome known exact solutions of the heat equation and gave identical results and compared well with experimentaldata of a known biochemical reaction the construction of computer programs based on the directstatement of the physical laws is a principle of general applicability which has been appliedto several other physical phenomena.cacm september 1964davids n.berger r l.ca640908 jb march 9 1978 5:13 pm1003 5 10031003 5 10031003 5 1003
