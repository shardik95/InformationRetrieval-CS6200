faster retrieval from context trees corrigendum)context trees provide a convenient way ofstoring data which is to be viewed as a hierarchy of contexts this note presents an algorithm which improveson previous context tree retrieval algorithms it is based on the observation that in typical uses contextchanges are infrequent relative to retrievals so that data can be cached to speed up retrieval a retrievalis started from the position of the previous retrieval and auxiliary structures are built up to makethe search rapid algorithms for addition and deletion of data and for garbage collection are outlined.cacm september 1976wegbreit b.context trees frame problem variable bindings data structures3.69 3.74 4.10ca760907 jb january 4 1978 8:49 am2832 5 28322832 5 28322832 5 2832
