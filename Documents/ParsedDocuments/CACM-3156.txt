computing connected components on parallel computerswe present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connectedcomponents of an undirected graph with n vertices in time o(log2n ano(log2n time bound also can be achieved using only n$n/log2n processors.the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closureof a symmetric boolean matrix we assume that the processors haveaccess to a common memory simultaneous access to the same locationis permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions.cacm august 1979hirschberg d.chandra a.sarwate d.graph theory parallel processing algorithms,transitive closure connected component5.25 5.32 6.22ca790802 db january 4 1980 12:18 pm3075 4 31563156 4 31563156 4 31563156 4 31562289 5 31562973 5 31563075 5 31563156 5 31563156 5 31563156 5 3156
