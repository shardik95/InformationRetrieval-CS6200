menu planning by computera computer code has been developed which plansmenus by finding minimum cost combinations of menu items such that the daily dietary gastronomicand production requirements can be satisfied for a sequence of days a fast special integer programmingalgorithm is described which approximates the theoretical solution to the problem if necessary anymenu can be changed on-line and then post-optimized up to 30 percent saving on food cost is possible a fortran program for the ibm 1410 is available on request a considerable amount of data processingmust precede the implementation of the system.cacm april 1964balistfy j l.ca640421 jb march 10 1978 12:26 am1088 5 10881088 5 10881088 5 10881658 5 10881088 6 1088
