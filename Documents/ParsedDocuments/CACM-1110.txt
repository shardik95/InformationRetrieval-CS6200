a fourier series method for the numerical solutionof a class of parabolic partial differential equations*a fourier series method is described which whenapplied to a certain class of parabolic partial differential equations reduces the problem to a systemof ordinary differential equations an application is given for which the method shows a considerable advantageover conventional finite difference methods.cacm march 1964forrington c v d.ca640322 jb march 10 1978 2:08 am1110 5 11101110 5 11101110 5 1110
