a preliminary system for the design of dbtg data structuresthe functional approach to database design isintroduced in this approach the goal of design is to derive a data structure which is capable of supportinga set of anticipated queries rather than a structure which models the business in some otherway an operational computer program is described which utilizers the functional approach to design datastructures conforming to the data base task group specifications the automatic programming technologyutilized by this program although typically used to generate procedure is here used to generate declaratives.cacm october 1975gerritsen r.network model of databases data base task group databasedesign data structure automatic programming translation nonprocedural languages3.5 3.64 3.7 4.2 5.23ca751001 jb january 6 1978 2:02 pm2155 4 27182406 4 27182710 4 27182715 4 27182716 4 27182717 4 27182718 4 27182765 4 27182817 4 27182888 4 27182901 4 27182957 4 27182959 4 27182965 4 27183087 4 27183154 4 27182046 5 27182718 5 27182718 5 27182718 5 27183147 5 27182718 6 2718
