a global parser for context-free phrase structure grammarsan algorithm for analyzing any context-free phrasestructure grammar and for generating a program which can then parse any sentence in the language orindicate that the given sentence is invalid is described the parser is of the top-to-bottom typeand is recursive  a number of heuristic procedures whose purpose is to shorten the basic algorithm by quicklyascertaining that certain substrings of the input sentence cannot correspond to the target nonterminalsymbols are included both the generating algorithm and the parser have been implemented in rcasnobol and have been tested successfully on a number of artificial grammars and on a subset of algol anumber of the routines for extracting data about a grammar such as minimum lengths of n-derivable stringsand possible prefixes are given and may be of interest apart from their application in this particular context.cacm april 1968unger s h.parser syntax-directed compiler context-freegrammars syntactic analysis translators3.42 4.12 5.24ca680402 jb february 23 1978 11:27 am1350 4 17681399 4 17681496 4 17681659 4 17681665 4 17681683 4 17681768 4 17681768 4 17681768 4 17681781 4 17681787 4 17681787 4 17681824 4 17681825 4 17681836 4 17681861 4 17681945 4 17681945 4 17682015 4 17682061 4 17682110 4 17682110 4 17682127 4 17682187 4 17682317 4 17682545 4 17682698 4 17682733 4 17683094 4 17681141 5 17681265 5 17681768 5 17681768 5 17681768 5 17681781 5 1768
