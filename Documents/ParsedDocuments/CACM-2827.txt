a parametric algorithm for drawing picturesof solid objects composed of quadric surfacesan algorithm for drawing pictures of three-dimensionalobjects with surfaces made up of patches of quadric surfaces is described the emphasis ofthis algorithm is on calculating the intersections of quadric surfaces a parameterization scheme is used each quadric surface intersection curve qsic is represented as a set of coefficients and parameterlimits each value of the parameter represents at most two points and these may easily be distinguished this scheme can find the coordinates of points of even quartic fourth-order intersection curves usingequations of no more than second order methods of parameterization for each type of osic are discussed,as well as surface bounding and hidden surface removal.cacm october 1976levin j.computer graphics hidden surface removal,quadric surface intersection curves3.41 5.12 5.13 5.19 8.2ca761004 jb january 3 1978 4:32 pm2816 4 28272828 4 28272827 4 28272827 4 28272913 4 28273047 4 28273116 4 28272751 5 28272771 5 28272827 5 28272827 5 28272827 5 2827
