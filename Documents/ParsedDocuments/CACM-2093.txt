a comparison of error improvement estimatesfor adaptive trapezoid integrationvarious simple choices of error improvement estimates for the trapezoidrule are studied to demonstrate a comparison procedure which isrelatively independent of the profusion of adaptive search and stoppingstrategies comparisons are based on x^r  the inclusionof the noninteger powers makes this more realistic than the usual polynomialbased comparison behavior near the singularity was foundto be the dominant factor and a new estimate based on a constantcurvature assumption and parametric differences was consideredslightly better than the other choices considered.cacm march 1970schweikert d g.adaptive integration error improvement estimate,trapezoid rule nonpolynomial error criteria5.16ca700305 jb february 13 1978 4:47 pm1352 4 20931352 4 20931352 4 20931352 4 20932048 4 20932048 4 20932074 4 20932074 4 20932074 4 20932093 4 20932093 4 20932093 4 20932093 4 20932093 4 20932093 4 20932550 4 20932550 4 20931092 5 20931298 5 20931573 5 20932093 5 20932093 5 20932093 5 2093429 5 2093834 5 2093872 5 2093
