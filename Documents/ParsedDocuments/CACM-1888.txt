spline function methods for nonlinear boundary-value problemsthe solution of the nonlinear differential equationy"f(x,y,y with two-point boundary conditions is approximated by a quintic or cubic spline functiony(x the method is well suited to nonuniform mesh size and dynamic mesh size allocation for uniformmesh size h the error in the quintic spline y(x is o(h^4 with typical error one-third that fromnumerov's method requiring the differential equation to be satisfied at the mesh points resultsin a set of difference equations which are block tridiagonal and so are easily solved by relaxation or other standard methods.cacm june 1969blue j l.boundary value problems differential equations,finite differences functional approximation iterative methods nonlinear equations spline functions5.13 5.15 5.17ca690605 jb february 17 1978 11:07 am1888 5 18881888 5 18881888 5 1888
