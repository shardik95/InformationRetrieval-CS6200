boundary networksa feasible computer procedure is describedfor determining the total or partial inclusion of arbitrarily given points and lines with respect to aset of general polygonal domains which partition a plane bounded region a scheme for the computer representationof the boundaries of the domains and an algorithm based on this scheme for evaluatingthe inclusion relations are specified in detail the method employs several levels of selection criteriafor the purpose of reducing the number of accesses to auxiliary storage devices and the amount of boundarydata for which processing is required.cacm january 1965loomis r g.ca650111 jb march 8 1978 2:31 pm1326 5 13261326 5 13261326 5 13261630 5 13262547 5 13262987 5 13263165 5 13261326 6 13261326 6 13261326 6 13261326 6 13261630 6 13261925 6 13262125 6 13262547 6 13262633 6 13262987 6 1326421 6 1326524 6 1326
