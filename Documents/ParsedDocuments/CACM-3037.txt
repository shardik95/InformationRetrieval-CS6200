a linear sieve algorithm for finding prime numbersa new algorithm is presented for finding allprimes between 2 and n the algorithm executes in time proportional to n assuming that multiplicationof integers not larger than n can be performed in unit time the method has the same arithmetic complexityas the algorithm presented by mairson 6 however our version is perhaps simpler and more elegant it is also easily extended to find the prime factorization of all integers between 2 and n in time proportional to n cacm december 1978gries d.misra j.primes algorithms data structures5.25 5.24 5.29ca781202 dh january 22 1979 11:12 am2896 4 30372972 4 30373037 4 30373037 4 30373039 4 30373043 4 30373073 4 30372732 5 30372927 5 30373037 5 30373037 5 30373037 5 3037
