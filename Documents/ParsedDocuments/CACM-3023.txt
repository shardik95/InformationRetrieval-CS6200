architecture of the ibm system/370this paper discusses the design considerationsfor the architectural extensions that distinguish system/370 from system/360 it comments on some experienceswith the original objectives for system/360 and on the efforts to achieve them and it describes thereasons and objectives for extending the architecture it covers virtual storage program control data-manipulationinstructions timing facilities multiprocessing debugging and monitoring error handling and input/outputoperations a final section tabulates some of the important parameters of the various ibmmachines which implement the architecture.cacm january 1978case r.padges a.computer systems architecture instructionsets virtual storage error handling6.0 6.21ca780107 jb march 28 1978 5:16 pm3023 5 30233023 5 30233023 5 3023
