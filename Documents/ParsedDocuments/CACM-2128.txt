a processor allocation method for time-sharinga scheduling algorithm is proposed which is intended to minimize changes of tasks on processors and thereby reduce over-head the algorithm also hasapplication to more general resource allocation problems it is implemented by means of a method for efficiently handling dynamically changing segmented lists.cacm january 1970mullery a p.driscoll g c.time sharing resource allocation scheduling algorithms,monitors dynamic allocation processorallocation multiprogramming multiprocessing timeslicing scheduling conversational systems interactive systems 3.80 4.30 4.31 4.32 6.33ca700103 jb february 14 1978 2:15 pm1751 4 21281892 4 21282128 4 21282218 4 21281752 5 21282128 5 21282128 5 21282128 5 2128
