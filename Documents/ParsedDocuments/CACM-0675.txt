coding clinical laboratory data for automatic storage and retrievala series of clinical laboratory codes have beendeveloped to accept and store urin analysis blood chemistry and hematology test results for automaticdata processing the codes although constructed as part of a computerized hospital simulation have beenable to handle the results of every laboratory test that they have encountered the unique feature ofthese codes is that they can accept conventionally recorded qualitative as well as quantitative test results consequently clinical test results need not be arbitrarily stratified standardized or alteredin any way to be coded this paper describes how the codes were developed and presents a listing of theurin analysis codes five criteria used in developing the codes are outlined and the problem of multiple-synonymousterminology is discussed a solution to the problem is described flexible computer-produced,composite laboratory reports are also discussed along with reproduction of such a report the paper concludesthat even though many problems remain unsolved the next ten years could witness the emergence of a practicalautomated information system in the laboratory.cacm november 1963gross l d.ca631117 jb march 13 1978 3:26 pm675 5 675675 5 675675 5 675
