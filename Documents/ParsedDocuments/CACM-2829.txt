texture and reflection in computer generated imagesin 1974 catmull developed a new algorithmfor rendering images of bivariate surface patches this paper describes extensions of this algorithm inthe areas of texture simulation and lighting models the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinatesystem which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the surface the intensity of the pattern at eachpicture element is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern definition function the shapeand size of this weighting function are chosen using digital signal processing theory the patch renderingalgorithm allows accurate computation of the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections the amount of light coming from a given direction ismodeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping and then added to the intensity obtained from the texturemapping several examples of images synthesized using these new techniques are included.cacm october 1976blinn j f.newell m e.computer graphics graphic display shading hidden surface removal3.41 5.12 5.15 8.2ca761002 jb january 4 1978 8:36 am2816 5 28292829 5 28292829 5 28292829 5 28293047 5 28292493 6 28292751 6 28292751 6 28292829 6 28292829 6 2829
