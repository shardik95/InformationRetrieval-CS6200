n-dimensional codes for detecting and correcting multiple errorsthe paper introduces a new family of codesfor detecting and correcting multiple errors in a binary-coded message the message itself is arranged(conceptually into a multidimensional rectangular array the processes of encoding and error detectionare based upon parity evaluations along prescribed dimensions of the array effectiveness of the codesis increased by introducing a system check bit which is essentially a parity check on the other paritybits only three-dimensional codes are discussed in this paper with parity evaluations along the horizontal,the vertical and one main diagonal however the family of codes is not restricted to three dimensions,as evidenced by the discussion by minnick and ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional single-bitselection plan used for another purpose 6 a four-dimensional code correcting three and detectingfour errors has been developed the extension to higher-dimensional codes with greater correction power is straightforward.cacm december 1961rubinoff m.ca611207 jb march 15 1978 10:23 pm243 5 243243 5 243243 5 243
