the synthesis of loop predicatescurrent methods for mechanical program verificationrequire a complete predicate specification on each loop because this is tedious and error prone,producing a program with complete correct predicates is reasonably difficult and would be facilitated by machineassistance this paper discusses techniques for mechanically synthesizing loop predicates two classesof techniques are considered 1 heuristic methods which derive loop predicates from boundary conditionsand/or partially specified inductive assertions 2 extraction methods which use input predicates andappropriate weak interpretations to obtain certain classes of loop predicates by an evaluation on the weak interpretation.cacm march 1974wegbreit b.program verification loop predicates inductiveassertions synthesis of loop predicates weak interpretations well-founded sets property extraction theorem proving3.64 4.19 4.22 5.24ca740206 jb january 18 1978 12:55 pm 2683 5 26832683 5 26832683 5 26832874 5 26833104 5 26831682 6 26832227 6 26832317 6 26832457 6 26832683 6 26832683 6 26832871 6 2683521 6 2683
