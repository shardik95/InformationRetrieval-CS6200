simulation of traffic flows in a networka computer simulation program which dealswith traffic flows in the network of a large area is described each road is segmented into blocks ofseveral ten-meter lengths and is represented by a bidirectional list in computer memory the movementof cars i.e the transfer of cars from one block to the next is expressed by a proper formula thisformula is based on the supposition that the speed of cars in a block is determined only by the density ofcars in the block and this speed-versus-density curve is empirically given the numerical values thissimulation scheme has its excellent point in that it makes it possible to trace the dynamic behaviorof traffic flows in a variety of situations some examples of which are given for an actual area of the city of kyoto japan.june 1969sakai t.nagao m.traffic simulation traffic flow traffic networktraffic control traffic density intersection signal setting vehicle road network list structure computer simulation3.57 3.23ca690603 jb february 17 1978 1:26 pm1890 4 18901890 5 18901890 5 18901890 5 1890757 5 1890
