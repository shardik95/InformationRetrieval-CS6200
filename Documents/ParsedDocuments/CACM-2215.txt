application of game tree searching techniquesto sequential pattern recognitiona sequential pattern recognition spr proceduredoes not test all the features of a pattern at once instead it selects a feature to be tested afterreceiving the result of that test the procedure either classifies the unknown pattern or selects anotherfeature to be tested etc medical diagnosis is an example of spr in this paper the authors suggestthat spr be viewed as a one-person game played against nature chance virtually all the powerful techniquesdeveloped for searching two-person strictly competitive game trees can easily be incorporated eitherdirectly or by analogy into spr procedures in particular one can incorporate the mini averagebacking-up procedure and the gamma procedure which are the analogues of the minimax backing-up procedure"and the alpha-beta procedure respectively some computer simulated experiments in character recognitionare presented the results indicate that the approach is promising.cacm february 1971slagle j r.lee r c t.sequential pattern recognition game tree searching,game against nature gamma procedure mini average backing-up procedure dynamic programming branch-and-boundapproach optimal solution3.60 3.63 5.42ca710206 jb february 8 1978 8:56 am2215 4 22152096 5 22152215 5 22152215 5 22152215 5 22153132 5 22152215 6 2215
