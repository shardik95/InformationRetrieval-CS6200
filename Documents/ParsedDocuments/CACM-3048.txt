performance evaluation of highly concurrentcomputers by deterministic simulationsimulation is presented as a practical techniquefor performance evaluation of alternative configurations of highly concurrent computers a techniqueis described for constructing a detailed deterministic simulation model of a system in the modela control stream replaces the instruction and data streams of the real system simulation of thesystem model yields the timing and resource usage statistics needed for performance evaluation withoutthe necessity of emulating the system as a case study the implementation of a simulator of a modelof the cpu-memory subsystem of the ibm 360/91 is described the results of evaluating some alternativesystem designs are discussed the experiments reveal that for the case study the major bottlenecksin the system are the memory unit and the fixed point unit further it appears that many of the sophisticatedpipelining and buffering technique simplemented in the architecture of the ibm 360/91 are of littlevalue when high-speed cache memory is used as in the ibm 360/195.cacm november 1978kumar b.davidson e.performance evaluation deterministic simulation,control stream concurrent computers6.20 8.1ca781103 dh january 26 1979 11:26 am3048 5 30483048 5 30483048 5 3048
