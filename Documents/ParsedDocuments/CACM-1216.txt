symbolic derivatives without list processing subroutines or recursiona routine has been developed which computes andprints out the symbolic derivative of an absolutely continuous elementary function of one or several variables no use is made of list-processing languages the chain rule is applied and the result is edited toproduce results as elegant and efficient as those obtained by hand computation a subset may be imbededin a formula translator to introduce a differentiation operator into an algebraic programming language.cacm august 1965smith p j.ca650808 jb march 6 1978 8:18 pm1028 4 12161028 4 12161216 4 12161216 4 12161216 4 12161278 4 12161278 4 12161347 4 12161347 4 12161392 4 12161396 4 12161396 4 12161396 4 12161536 4 1216964 4 12161028 5 12161029 5 12161216 5 12161216 5 12161216 5 1216561 5 1216
