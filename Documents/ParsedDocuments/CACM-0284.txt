manipulation of algebraic expressionsan algorithm for algebraically manipulatingexpressions of the form sum{cipi i=1,n has been developed in conjunction with the development of programsfor systems analysis problems this algorithm enablesus to derive over-all system transfer functionsfrom algebraically described block diagrams of any linear continuous multi-loop feedback system themachine representation of the derived expression is by virtue of the algorithm in a form which simplifiesthe task of compiling the algorithm was developed for a particular purpose in connection withsystem analysis studies however its application as a mathematical device extends far beyondthe confines of the original problem.cacm september 1961rom a r m.ca610910 jb march 16 1978 9:36 pm964 5 2841396 5 284284 5 284284 5 284284 5 284964 6 2841028 6 2841029 6 2841083 6 2841132 6 2841214 6 2841278 6 2841334 6 2841365 6 2841386 6 2841387 6 2841388 6 2841392 6 2841393 6 2841394 6 2841395 6 2841396 6 2841397 6 2841496 6 284284 6 284284 6 284407 6 2843199 6 2843200 6 2843201 6 2843202 6 2843203 6 2843204 6 284561 6 284561 6 284730 6 284759 6 284
