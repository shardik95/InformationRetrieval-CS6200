scalar and planar valued curve fitting using splines under tensionthe spline under tension was introduced byschweikert in an attempt to imitate cubic splines but avoid the spurious critical points they induce the defining equations are presented here together with an efficient method for determining the necessaryparameters and computing the resultant spline the standard scalar-valued curve fitting problem is discussed,as well as the fitting of open and closed curves in the plane the use of these curves and theimportance of the tension in the fitting of contour lines are mentioned as application.cacm april 1974cline a k.interpolation splines contouring curve fitting5.13 8.2ca740414 jb january 18 1978 9:23 am2656 4 26562655 5 26562656 5 26562656 5 26562656 5 26562656 6 2656
