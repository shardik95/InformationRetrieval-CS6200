an analysis of algorithms for the dutch national flag problemsolutions to the dutch national flag problemhave been given by dijkstra 1 and meyer 3 dijkstra starts with a simple program and arrives atan improved program by refinement both of the algorithms given by dijkstra are shown to have an expected numberof swaps which is 2/3n  0(1 and that these values differ at most by 1/3 of a swap and asymptoticallyby 1/4 of a swap the algorithm of meyer is shown to have expected swap complexity 5/9n.cacm october 1978mcmaster c.algorithmic analysis dutch national flagproblem refinement structured programming4.0 5.24 5.25 5.3ca781006 dh january 29 1979 5:47 pm3055 5 30553055 5 30553055 5 30553170 5 30553055 6 30553104 6 3055
