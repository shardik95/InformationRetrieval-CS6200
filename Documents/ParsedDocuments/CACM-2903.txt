improving programs by the introduction of recursiona new technique of program transformation,called recursion in troduction is described and applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems by using recursion in troduction algorithms which manipulate a stack are first translated intorecursive algorithms in which no stack operations occur these algorithms are then subjected to a secondtransformation a method of recursion elimination called tabulation to produce programs with a veryefficient running time in particular it is shown how the fast linear pattern matching algorithm of knuth,morris and pratt can be derived in a few steps from a simple nonlinear stack algorithm.cacm november 1977bird r s.program transformation optimization of programs,recursion elimination pattern matching algorithms stacks computational induction4.0 4.2 5.20 5.24 5.25ca771113 jb december 27 1977 6:29 am2326 4 29032457 4 29032842 4 29032903 4 29032192 5 29032903 5 29032903 5 29032903 5 2903
