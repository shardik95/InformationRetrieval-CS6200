expected time bounds for selectiona new selection algorithm is presented whichis shown to be very efficient on the average both theoretically and practically the number of comparisonsused to select the ith smallest of n numbers is n+min(i,n-i)o(n a lower bound within 9percent of the above formula is also derived.cacm march 1975floyd r w.rivest r l.selection computational complexity medians tournaments quantiles5.30 5.39ca750304 jb january 9 1978 4:52 pm1919 4 27842191 4 27842388 4 27842783 4 27842784 4 27842784 4 27842784 4 27843054 4 27843121 4 2784864 4 27841729 5 2784309 5 27842783 5 27842784 5 27842784 5 27842784 5 27842837 5 27842784 6 27842842 6 2784
