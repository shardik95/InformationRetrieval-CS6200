thinning algorithms on rectangular hexagonal and triangular arraysin this report three thinning algorithms aredeveloped one each for use with rectangular hexagonal and triangular arrays the approach to thedevelopment of each algorithm is the same pictorial results produced by each of the algorithms are presentedand the relative performances of the algorithms are compared it is found that the algorithm operatingwith the triangular array is the most sensitive to image irregularities and noise yet it will yielda thinned image with an overall reduced number of points it is concluded that the algorithm operating inconjunction with the hexagonal array has features which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays.cacm september 1972deutsch e s.thinning algorithms rectangular hexagonal,triangular arrays image processing skeleton3.64ca720907 jb january 27 1978 4:25 pm2283 5 22832283 5 22832283 5 2283
