canonical structure in attribute based file organizationa new file structure for attribute based retrievalis proposed in this paper it allows queries involving arbitrary boolean functions of the attribute-valuepairs to be processed without taking intersections of lists the structure is highly dependent on theway in which the file is to be used and is uniquely determined by the specification of the allowed queries thus for example the structure for retrieval on the basis of ranges of values of a given attribute wouldbe very different from one where only retrieval on the basis of a single value is permitted the fileorganization being proposed is based on the atoms of a boolean algebra generated by the queries the desirableproperties claimed for this structure are proved and file maintenance questions are discussed.cacm september 1971wong e.chiang t c.address calculation atoms of boolean algebra,attributes boolean functions boolean queries file organization information retrieval invertedfile key words multilist queries searches 3.70 3.73 3.74ca710904 jb february 2 1978 2:22 pm2160 4 21602688 4 21602114 5 21602160 5 21602160 5 21602160 5 21603134 5 21601976 6 21602160 6 21602524 6 21602990 6 2160
