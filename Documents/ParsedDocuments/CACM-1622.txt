an efficient procedure for the generation of closed subsetsan efficient algorithm is described for generatingsubsets of a set s which satisfy constraints of the form if s(i is a member of the subset thens(j must also be a member of the subset the algorithm has been programmed in the wisp language andsuccessfully run on the ibm 7094 in connection with a routine to detect feedback in multidimensional iterative networks.cacm march 1967waite w m.ca670307 jb february 28 1978 1:18 pm1622 5 16221622 5 16221622 5 1622
