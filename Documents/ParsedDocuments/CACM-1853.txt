compact list representation definition,garbage collection and system implementationcompact lists are stored sequentially in memory,rather than chained with pointers since this is not always convenient the swym system permitsa list to be chained compact or any combination of the two a description is given of that list representationand the operators implemented most are similar to those of lisp 1.5 the system garbage collectorattempts to make all lists compact it relocates and rearranges all of list storage using temporary storage this unique list-compacting garbage collection algorithm is presented in detail several classes of themacros used to implement the system are described finally consideration is given to those design factorsessential to the success of a plex processing system implementation.cacm september 1969hansen w j.data structure data representation list structure,list representation list compact list garbage collection relocation storage reclamation macro,primitive list operations plex processing plex pointer list processing system lisp free storage3.49 4.20 4.22 4.49 4.9ca690902 jb february 15 1978 5:01 pm1853 4 18532003 4 18531710 5 18531853 5 18531853 5 18531853 5 18531972 5 18532249 5 18532736 5 18533074 5 18531626 6 18531626 6 18531708 6 18531826 6 18531826 6 18531826 6 18531853 6 18531853 6 18531853 6 18531853 6 18531972 6 18531972 6 18532723 6 1853
