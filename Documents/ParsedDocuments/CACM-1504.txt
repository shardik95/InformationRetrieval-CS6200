algorithms for finding a fundamental setof cycles for an undirected linear graphgiven the adjacency matrix of the graph the algorithmpresented in this paper finds a spanning tree and then constructs the set of fundamental cycles our algorithm is slower than an algorithm presented by welch by a ratio of n/3 n is the number of nodes)but requires less storage for graphs with a large number of nodes and edges when storage is limited ouralgorithm is superior to welch's however when the graphs are small or machine storage is very large,welch's algorithm is superior timing estimates and storage requirements for both methods are presented.cacm december 1967gotlieb c c.corneil d g.ca671204 jb february 26 19782:35 pm1504 4 15043040 4 15041145 5 15041504 5 15041504 5 15041504 5 15041847 5 15041961 5 15042052 5 15041008 6 15041013 6 15041369 6 15041504 6 15041504 6 15041504 6 15041540 6 15041847 6 1504
