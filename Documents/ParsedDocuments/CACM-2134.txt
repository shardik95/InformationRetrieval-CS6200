an extension of the munkres algorithm forthe assignment problem to rectangular matricesthe assignment problem together with munkresproposed algorithm for its solution in square matrices is presented first then the authors developan extension of this algorithm which permits a solution for rectangular matrices timing resultsobtained by using an adapted version of silver's algol procedure are discussed and a relation betweensolution time and problem size is given.cacm december 1971bourgeois f.lassalle j.operations research optimization theory assignmentproblem rectangular matrices algorithm5.39 5.40ca711209 jb february 2 1978 9:46 am2133 4 21342134 4 2134124 5 21342133 5 21342134 5 21342134 5 21342134 5 2134124 6 21342134 6 2134
