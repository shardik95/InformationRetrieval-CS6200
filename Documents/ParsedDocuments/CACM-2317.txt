programming systems and languages 1965-1975in spite of impressive gains by pl/i fortranand cobol remain the languages in which most of the world's production programs are written and willremain so into the foreseeable future there is a great deal of theoretical interest in algol 68and in extensible languages but so far at least they have had little practical impact problem-orientedlanguages may very well become the most important language development area in the next five to ten years in the operating system area all major computer manufacturers set out to produce very ambitious multiprogrammingsystems and they all ran into similar problems a number of university projects,though notdirectly comparable to those of the manufacturers have contributed greatly to a better understandingof operating system principles important trends include the increased interest in the development ofsystem measurement and evaluation techniques,and increased use of microprogramming for some programming system functions.cacm july 1972rosen s.languages operating systems programmingsystems multiprogramming history1.2 4.22 4.32ca720711 jb january 30 1978 1:47 pm1665 4 23171768 4 23171781 4 23171787 4 23171805 4 23171824 4 23171825 4 23171828 4 23171836 4 23171846 4 23171854 4 23171861 4 23171877 4 23171892 4 23171960 4 23172015 4 23172110 4 23172126 4 23172127 4 23172150 4 23172150 4 23172187 4 23172188 4 23172218 4 23172228 4 23172256 4 23172314 4 23172317 4 23172317 4 23172317 4 23172317 4 23172317 4 23172317 4 23172317 4 23172317 4 23172319 4 23172358 4 23172377 4 23172342 4 23172342 4 23172376 4 23172376 4 23172379 4 23172424 4 23172482 4 23172545 4 23172546 4 23172618 4 23172618 4 23172625 4 23172632 4 23172698 4 23172704 4 23172723 4 23172733 4 23172738 4 23172740 4 23172741 4 23172842 4 23172867 4 23173184 4 23173184 4 23171198 5 23171572 5 23171693 5 23171749 5 23171753 5 23171781 5 23172126 5 23172148 5 23172317 5 23172317 5 23172317 5 23172874 5 23171682 6 23172227 6 23172317 6 23172683 6 23172871 6 2317521 6 2317
