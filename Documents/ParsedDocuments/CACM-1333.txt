reducing truncation errors using cascading accumulatorswhen accumulating a large number of quantitiesas in numerical integration the sum itself may become much larger than the individual addends this results in truncation error much of this error can be eliminated using cascading accumulatorsas noted in a recent article by wolfe a simpler and slightly more flexible algorithm is presented whichdeals also with the case of negative addends.cacm january 1965ross d r.ca650104 jb march 8 1978 2:54 pm1328 4 13331333 4 13332144 4 13331052 5 13331333 5 13331333 5 13331333 5 1333
