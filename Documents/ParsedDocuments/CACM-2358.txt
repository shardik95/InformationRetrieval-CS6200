the multics virtual memory concepts and designas experience with use of on-line operatingsystems has grown the need to share information among system users has become increasingly apparent many contemporary systems permit some degree of sharing usually sharing is accomplished by allowingseveral users to share data via input and output of information stored in files kept in secondary storage through the use of segmentation however multics provides direct hardware addressing by user andsystem programs of all information independent of its physical storage location information is storedin segments each of which is potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and accessprivilege here the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in multicsare first discussed under the assumption that all information resides in large segmented main memory since the size of main memory on contemporary systems is rather limited it is then shown how the multicssoftware achieves the effect of a large segmented main memory through the use of the honeywell645 segmentation and paging hardware.cacm may 1972bensoussan a.clingen c t.daley r c.operating system multics virtual memory segmentation,information sharing paging memory management memory hierarchy4.30 4.31 4.32ca720502 jb january 31 1978 11:24 am1753 4 23581754 4 23581892 4 23581901 4 23582085 4 23582095 4 23582218 4 23582277 4 23582317 4 23582319 4 23582329 4 23582358 4 23582358 4 23582358 4 23582358 4 23582377 4 23582373 4 23582372 4 23582380 4 23582434 4 23582499 4 23582501 4 23582582 4 2358488 4 23582625 4 23582626 4 23582669 4 23582828 4 23582840 4 23582863 4 23582881 4 23582928 4 23582996 4 23583006 4 23583067 4 2358274 5 23581746 5 23581751 5 23581753 5 23582358 5 23582358 5 23582358 5 23582377 5 23582625 5 23582626 5 23582669 5 23581471 6 23581471 6 23581746 6 23581746 6 23581749 6 23581751 6 23581753 6 23581901 6 23582017 6 23582358 6 23582358 6 23582358 6 23582358 6 23582377 6 23582438 6 23582625 6 23582629 6 2358
