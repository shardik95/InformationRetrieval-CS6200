generation of positive test matrices with known positive spectrasufficient conditions are given for a realmatrix to be similar to a positive matrix this result is used to construct a similarity transformationwhich when applied to a particular upper triangular matrix yields a positive matrix with a preassigned positive spectrum.cacm august 1968hall c a.porsching t a.test matrices positive matrices similaritytransformation positive eigenvalues5.1 5.14ca680807 jb february 22 1978 10:42 am1707 4 17071707 4 17071047 5 17071707 5 17071707 5 17071707 5 17071876 5 17072099 5 1707511 5 17071662 6 17071707 6 17071707 6 1707
