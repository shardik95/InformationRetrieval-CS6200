27 bits are not enough for 8-digit accuracyfrom the inequality 10^8  2^27 we are likelyto conclude that we can represent 8-digit decimal floating-point numbers accurately by 27-bit floating-pointnumbers however we need 28 significant bits to represent some 8-digit numbers accurately in general we can show that if 10^p  2^q-1 then q significant bits are always enough for p-digit decimalaccuracy finally we can define a compact 27-bit floating-point representation that will give 28significant bits for numbers of practical importance.cacm february 1967goldberg i b.ca670208 jb february 28 1978 2:38 pm1634 5 16341634 5 16341634 5 16341783 5 16341843 5 16341634 6 16341634 6 16341783 6 1634
