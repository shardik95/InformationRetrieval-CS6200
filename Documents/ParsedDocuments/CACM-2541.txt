an overview of the ispl computer system designthis paper explores the advantages of the concurrentdesign of the language operating system and machine via microcode to create an interactive programminglaboratory it describes the synergistic effect that the freedom to move and alter features fromone of these domains to another has had on the design of this system which has not been implemented this freedom simplified both incremental compilation and the system's addressing structure and centralized thecommunication mechanisms enabling the construction of hierarchical subsystems it also suggested an importantnew concept for operating systems separation of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resourceallocation this separation enables incorporation of new scheduling algorithms decision of what to do withoutendangering the system integration correctly performing the scheduling decisions)cacm february 1973balzer r m.concurrent design operating-system scheduling,interprogram communication incremental compilation virtual addressing debugging hierarchical subsystems4.0 4.13 4.22 4.30 4.32 4.41 4.42 6.20ca730207 jb january 24 1978 1:59 pm1323 4 25411358 4 25411380 4 25411665 4 25411781 4 25411787 4 25411989 4 25412112 4 25412193 4 25412326 4 25412477 4 25412534 4 25412541 4 25412541 4 25412594 4 25412698 4 25412733 4 25412820 4 25413004 4 25413073 4 25413155 4 25412541 5 25412541 5 25412541 5 25413186 5 2541799 5 2541
