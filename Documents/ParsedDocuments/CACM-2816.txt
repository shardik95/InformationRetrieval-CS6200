optimal reorganization of distributed space disk filesin most database organizations the cost of accessingthe database will increase due to structural changes caused by updates and insertions by reorganizingthe database,the access costs can be reduced a basic problem is to establish the proper tradeoff betweenperformance storage costs and reorganization costs this paper considers the optimum points at whichto reorganize a database a disk file organization which allows for distributed free space is described a cost function describing the excess costs due to physical disorganization is defined and this functionis minimized to obtain the optimum reorganization points numerical examples based on the characteristicsof existing disk storage devices are given.cacm november 1976maruyama k.smith s e.disk file free space,retrieval insertion deterioration reorganization3.70 3.73ca761107 jb january 3 1978 2:59 pm2816 4 28162816 4 28162816 4 28162828 4 28162827 4 28162913 4 28163047 4 28163047 4 28163129 4 28162493 5 28162751 5 28162816 5 28162816 5 28162816 5 28162829 5 28163129 5 28162493 6 28162816 6 2816
