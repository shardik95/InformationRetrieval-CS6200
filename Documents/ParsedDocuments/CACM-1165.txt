the spectra 70/45 emulator for the rca 301the rca 301 emulator system is supplied withthe spectra 70/45 as a reprogramming aid it allows an rca 301 object program to be run on the spectra70/45 without necessitating changes in the rca 301 object code execution rates are considerablybetter than traditional simulation the emulator provides an increase in throughput capacity for the301 user on the spectra 70/45 the emulator makes use of both hardware micro-program routines andsoftware routines to accomplish its function.cacm december 1965benjamin r i.ca651204 jb march 6 1978 4:15 pm1165 5 11651165 5 11651165 5 1165
