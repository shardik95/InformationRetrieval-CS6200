general performance analysis of key-to-addresstransformation methods using an abstract file conceptthis paper presents a new approach to the analysisof performance of the various key-to-address transformation methods in this approach the keys ina file are assumed to have been selected from the key space according to a certain probabilistic selectionalgorithm all files with the same number of keys selected from this key space will be suitably weightedin accordance with the algorithm and the average performance of the transformation methods onthese files will be used as the potential of these methods using this analysis methods with the same overallperformance can be classified and key distributions partial to certain transformations can be identified all this can be done analytically the approach is applied to a group of transformation methodsusing files whose keys are selected randomly.cacm october 1973lum v y.hashing hashing techniques hashing methods hash coding,key transformation key-to-address transformation direct addressing randomizing random access scatterstorage information retrieval hashing analysis randomization performance analysis3.7 3.72 3.73 3.74 3.79 4.9 5.9ca731003 jb january 20 1978 11:51 am2258 4 24372319 4 24372313 4 24372359 4 24372437 4 24372552 4 24372781 4 24372860 4 24372991 4 24372203 5 24372437 5 24372437 5 24372437 5 2437
