computer construction of project networksproject networks are used in pert and cpm an algorithm is given for constructing project networks directly from the project precedence relations the algorithm creates dummy activities and topologically orders the arcs and nodes the number ofnodes created is minimal for the given precedence relations it has been experimentally programmedin fortran ii for the ibm 7094.cacm july 1968fisher a c.liebman j s.nemhauser g l.project networks pert cpm topologicalordering network construction by computer5.32ca680706 jb february 22 1978 12:07 pm1723 4 1723758 4 17231723 5 17231723 5 17231723 5 17232515 5 1723441 5 17231723 6 1723
