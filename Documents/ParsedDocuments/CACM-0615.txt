addressing multidimensional arraysa useful method of representing a function ofn variables is to consider the function to assume its values at selected points in n-dimensional space although this picture is of value to the analyst the elements of an n-dimensional array must exist inconventional storage as a linear array or vector the means of performing the transformation of a setof indices locating on array element in n-space to the location address of the element in its storagevector is the subject of this paper it is noted that the index address transformation is computationallyidentical to the conversion of a number from a fixed to a mixed radix number system several waysof implementing the transformation are described.cacm april 1962hellerman h.ca620402 jb march 20 1978 2:29 pm435 5 615615 5 615615 5 615615 5 615849 5 615155 6 615196 6 615615 6 615615 6 615
