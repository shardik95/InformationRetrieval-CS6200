illumination for computer generated picturesthe quality of computer generated images ofthree-dimensional scenes depends on the shading technique used to paint the objects on the cathode-raytube screen the shading algorithm itself depends in part on the method for modeling the object whichalso determines the hidden surface algorithm the various methods of object modeling shading and hiddensurface removal are thus strongly interconnected several shading techniques corresponding to differentmethods of object modeling and the related hidden surface algorithms are presented here human visualperception and the fundamental laws of optics are considered in the development of a shading rule thatprovides better quality and increased realism in generated images.cacm june 1975phong b t.computer graphics graphic display hidden surface removal.3.26 3.41 8.2ca750602 jb january 9 1978 1:46 pm2751 5 27512751 5 27512751 5 27512816 5 27512827 5 27512828 5 27512913 5 27513047 5 27511751 6 27512004 6 27512493 6 27512751 6 27512751 6 27512751 6 27512751 6 27512751 6 27512771 6 27512829 6 27512829 6 27512841 6 2751
