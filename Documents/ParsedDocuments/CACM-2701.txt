a fast and usually linear algorithm for globalflow analysis abstract only-complete paper jacm 23,1 january 1976)a new algorithm for global flow analysis onreducible graphs is presented the algorithm is shown to treat a very general class of function spaces for a graph of e edges the algorithm has a worst case time bound of o(e log e function operations it is also shown that in programming terms the number of operations is proportional to e plus thenumber of exits from program loops consequently a restriction to one-entry one-exit control structureslinearity the algorithm can be extended to yet larger classes of function spaces and graphs by relaxingthe time bound examples are given of code improvement problems which can be solved using the algorithm.cacm december 1975graham s l.wegman m.global flow analysis data flow code optimization,common subexpression elimination live-dead analysis information propagation flow graph reducibility,go-to-less programming depth-first search path compression4.12 5.24 5.25 5.32ca751206 jb january 5 1978 4:08 pm2701 5 27012701 5 27012701 5 2701
