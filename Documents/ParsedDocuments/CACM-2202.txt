dynamic microprogramming processor organization and programminga dynamically microprogrammed processor is characterizedby a small 4^k 64-bit word read-write micro storage the access time of this storage issimilar to the cycle time of the machine 50-100 nsec this microstorage is used to contain both dataand subroutines the micro instructions in such a processor differ from the conventional in thatthey perform only purely combinatorial operations sequencing is under the control of the microinstruction.the presence of the read-write microstorage permits a more flexible assignment of resources than theread-only storage in particular the processor developed in this paper stresses the simultaneous operation(within the microinstruction of the adder shifter masker and testing facilities of the processor a microassembly language is developed and the overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed the efficiency of a flexible software linkage scheme is examined as to its overhead for various subroutinecharacteristics finally three examples of problem-oriented programming are considered and theresulting coding is compared against a system/360 assembly language version with the technology normalized.cacm april 1971tucker a b.flynn m j.microprogramming,read-write microstorage,subroutine linkage execution speed 6.2ca710403 jb february 3 1978 3:58 pm2202 4 22022527 4 22021542 5 22022202 5 22022202 5 22022202 5 2202
