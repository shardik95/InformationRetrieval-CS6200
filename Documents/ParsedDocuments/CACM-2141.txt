algorithmic selection of the bestmethod for compressing map data stringsthe best of a dozen different methods forcompressing map data is illustrated the choices are generated by encoding data strings-sequence of likecodes-by three methods and in four directions relationships are developed between compression alternativesto avoid comparing all of them the technique has been used to compress data from forest resource maps,but is widely applicable to map and photographic data reduction.cacm december 1971amidon e l.akin g s.data compression map storage information retrieval,input/output run coding data reduction3.71 3.74ca711202 jb february 2 1978 10:23 am2141 5 21412141 5 21412141 5 2141
