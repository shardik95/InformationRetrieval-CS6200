an information-theoretic approach totext searching in direct access systemsusing direct access computer files of bibliographicinformation an attempt is made to overcome one of the problems often associated with informationretrieval namely the maintenance and use of large dictionaries the greater part of which is used onlyinfrequently a novel method is presented which maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution this ismore suited to implementation on storage devices this method treats text as a string of characters ratherthan words bounded by spaces and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence aremore even than those of word types the members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.the rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organizationand promises considerable cost advantages.cacm june 1974barton i j.creasey s e.lynch m f.snell m j.text searching information theory file organization,direct access information retrieval character string bit vector3.42 3.70 3.73 3.74 5.6ca740615 jb january 17 1978 2:07 pm2532 4 26312631 4 26312631 4 26312746 4 26313001 4 26312139 5 26312532 5 26312631 5 26312631 5 26312631 5 2631
