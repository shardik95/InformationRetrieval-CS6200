conversion of decision tables by rule mask method without rule masktwo algorithms for generating computer programsfrom decision tables are described the algorithms allow handling limited entry extended entry and mixedentry tables the algorithms are based on the rule mask method but need not have the masks at executiontime they perform the logical operations immediately rather than at the end of the interpretingprocess execution time can be considerably reduced by instantly marking rules which are not applicable algorithms1 and 2 or conditions which are already tested algorithm 2 the new algorithms combine to acertain degree the advantages of mask methods with those of tree methods.cacm october 1972dathe g.decision tables rule mask rule mask method,rule mask technique program generator3.50 4.12 4.19 4.29ca721005 jb january 27 1978 3:02 pm1354 4 22731354 4 22731354 4 22731488 4 22731488 4 22731684 4 22731994 4 22732053 4 22732053 4 22732053 4 22732053 4 22732220 4 22732220 4 22732220 4 22732220 4 22732221 4 22732273 4 22732273 4 22732273 4 22732273 4 22732273 4 22732273 4 22732453 4 22732453 4 22732453 4 22732453 4 22732517 4 22732598 4 22732598 4 22732726 4 22732726 4 22732726 4 22732726 4 22732856 4 22732856 4 22732856 4 22732856 4 22732856 4 22733034 4 22733113 4 22731172 5 22731237 5 22731327 5 22731354 5 22732053 5 22732220 5 22732273 5 22732273 5 22732273 5 2273
