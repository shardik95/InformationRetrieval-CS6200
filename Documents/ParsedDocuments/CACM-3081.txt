shallow binding in lisp 1.5shallow binding is a scheme which allows thevalue of a variable to be accessed in a bounded amount of computation an elegant model for shallow bindingin lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching is an environment tree transformation called rerooting rerooting is completely general and reversible and is optional in the sense that a lisp 1.5 interpreterwill operate correctly whether or not rerooting is invoked one very context change since rerootingleaves assoc v a invariant for all variables v and all environments a the programmer can have accessto a rerooting primitive shallow which gives him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow ordeep and which affects only the speed of execution of a program not its semantics in addition multipleprocesses can be active in the same environment structure so long as rerooting is an indivisible operation finally the concept of rerooting is shown to combine the concept of shallow binding in lisp withdijkstra's display for algol and hence is a general model for shallow binding.cacm july 1978baker h jr.lisp 1.5 environment trees funarg's shallow binding,deep binding multiprogramming algol display4.13 4.22 4.32ca780707 dh february 7 1979 4:14 pm2625 4 30812922 4 30813081 4 30813101 4 30813112 4 30812438 5 30813081 5 30813081 5 30813081 5 3081
