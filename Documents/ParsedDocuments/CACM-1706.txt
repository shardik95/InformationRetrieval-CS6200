champ-character manipulation proceduresa new programming language facility for symbolmanipulation is described string procedures may be declared and called in a standard algol context algol procedures can in turn be called by string procedures so that numeric and symbolic processes mayconveniently be programmed together concatenation and a variant of snobol's pattern matching make upa set of primitive commands these are assembled together into conditional expressions which are to beused to provide alternative computational patterns arrays of strings are processed using quantifiers the class of things which may be assigned to an identifier can be restricted by a procedure expressedin the notation the language facilities have been implemented in the algol compiler for the burroughs b5500.cacm august 1968storm e f.symbol manipulation string handling charactermanipulation conditional expressions procedures structure matching recursive programming quantifiers4.22 4.13ca680808 jb february 22 1978 10:39 am1024 4 17061051 4 17061102 4 17061132 4 17061390 4 17061395 4 17061486 4 17061549 4 17061706 4 17061706 4 17061826 4 17061878 4 1706378 4 17062060 4 17062155 4 17062168 4 17062719 4 17062723 4 17062838 4 17062842 4 17062855 4 17062879 4 17063077 4 17063080 4 17063106 4 1706627 4 1706106 4 17061180 5 1706210 5 17061706 5 17061706 5 17061706 5 1706
