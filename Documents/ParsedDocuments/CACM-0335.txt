some numerical experiments using newton's methodfor nonlinear parabolic and ellipticboundary-value problemsusing a generalization of newton's method a nonlinearparabolic equation of the form u(t)u(xx)g(u and a nonlinear elliptic equation u(xx)u(yy)exp(u)are solved numerically comparison of these results with results obtained using the picard iteration procedureshow that in many cases the quisi linearization method offers substantial advantages in both time and accuracy.cacm april 1961bellman r.juncosa m l.kalaba r.ca610433 jb march 16 1978 11:20 pm335 5 335335 5 335335 5 335
