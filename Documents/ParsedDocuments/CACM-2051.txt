a pl/i program to assist the comparative linguista practical pl/i program is described whichcan assist comparative linguists to determinethe regular sound correspondences between genetically related languages.the investigator must arrange data for input by aligning pairsof suspected cognates the program tabulates the correspondences,and uses list processing techniques to sort and count them.each pair of words is then assigned a relative value that is a functionof the total frequency in the data of each correspondence foundin that pair of words the output is a list of all correspondencetypes with their frequency of occurrence in the data and aseparate listing of each correspondence with all word-pairs showingthat correspondence unless their relative value is below an arbitrarily chosen cutoff point the article explains the usefulness,as well as the limitations of the programs and illustrates itsuse with a small portion of hypothetical data.cacm june 1970frantz d g.comparative linguistics naturallanguage processing comparative method historical linguistics diachroniclinguistics genetic relationship sound change soundcorrespondence regular correspondence list processing3.42ca700604 jb february 13 1978 11:51 am2051 5 20512051 5 20512051 5 2051
