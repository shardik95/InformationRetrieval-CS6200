sorting by replacement selectingin sorting by replacement selecting the expectedlength of a sequence beginning with the i-th element i>1 is proved to be 2f in accordance witha conjecture of e h friend where f is the number of memory cells used the expected length of the j-thsequence is determined to be f times a j-th degree polynomial in e such that the value of this polynomialapproaches 2 as j approaches infinity recursive formulas are obtained for both the mean and the standarddeviation of the length of the j-th sequence the mathematical proofs of these results are basedupon the assumption that n the number of items to be sorted is infinite but it is shown that the errordue to the finiteness of n approaches zero rapidly as n increases.cacm february 1967gasner b j.ca670204 jb february 28 1978 3:56 pm1638 4 16382176 4 16382272 4 16381638 5 16381638 5 16381638 5 16381867 5 16382272 5 1638677 5 16381638 6 16381638 6 1638677 6 1638
