petri nets and speed independent designpetri nets are investigated as one method ofmodeling speed independent asynchronous circuits a study of circuit realizations of petri nets leadsto a demonstration of their usefulness in modeling speed independent operation this usefulness is emphasizedby the design of a speed independent processor from modules developed in the investigation of petri net implementation.cacm august 1973misunas d.speed independent asynchronous petri net6.1 6.33ca730805 jb january 23 1978 10:46 am2469 5 24692469 5 24692469 5 2469
