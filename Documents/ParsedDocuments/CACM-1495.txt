solution of transcendental equations by series reversionan algorithm is developed for expressing thesolution y of the equation f(y  g(x as a power series in x  x0 when f and g are given as power series,andthe root y0 is known at y=x0 the algorithm is illustrated for the equation y^y  x i.e 1+y)ln(1+y  ln(1+x)cacm january 1966thacher jr h c.ca660102 jb march 3 1978 4:27 pm1495 4 14951494 5 14951495 5 14951495 5 14951495 5 14951495 6 1495
