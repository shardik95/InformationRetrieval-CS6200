data filtering applied to information storage and retrieval applicationsmanipulation of data strings is the most complexprocessing function in information storage and retrieval applications data string manipulationis discussed within the context of an interpretive processing environment controlled by the use of proceduraldirectives the sequence of procedural directives is derived from a job assumed to be expressed in a user-orientedsource language each data string with the structured data environment data bank is explicitlyor implicitly related to a format declarationresiding in a format library the processing mechanicsassociated with data string manipulation is developed in accordance with a generalized data filtering concept this results in the implementation of a two-part data filter module that satisfies internal processingfunctions by filtering data strings through format declarations associated with its input and output ports.cacm november 1966larsen r p.ca661101 jb march 2 1978 3:52 pm1359 5 13591359 5 13591359 5 1359
