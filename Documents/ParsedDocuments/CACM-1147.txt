on the numerical solution of boundary value problemsfor linear ordinary differential equations*a numerical method is presented for the solutionof boundary value problems involving linear ordinary differential equations the method describedis noniterative and makes use of any one-step numerical integration scheme to reduce the problem fromone of boundary values to one of initial values comments are made concerning some numerical resultsof applying the method to a specific problem in addition an extension of the algorithm describedto more general problems is discussed.cacm january 1964day j t.collins ii g w.ca640108 jb march 10 1978 5:32 am1147 5 11471147 5 11471147 5 11471274 5 11471147 6 1147
