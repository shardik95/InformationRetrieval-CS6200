a user authentication scheme not requiring secrecy in the computerin many computer operating systems a user authenticateshimself by entering a secret password known solely to himself and the system the system comparesthis password with one recorded in a password table which is available to only the authenticationprogram the integrity of the system depends on keeping the table secret in this paper a passwordscheme is presented which does not require secrecy in the computer all aspects of the system includingall relevant code and data bases may be known by anyone attempting to intrude the scheme is basedon using a function h which the would-be intruder is unable to invert this function is applied to theuser's password and the result compared to a table entry a match being interpreted as authentication ofthe user the intruder may know all about h and have access to the table but he can penetrate the systemonly if he can invert h to determine an input that produces a given output this paper discussesissues surrounding selection of a suitable h two different plausible arguments are given that penetrationwould be exceedingly difficult and it is then argued that more rigorous results are unlikely finally,some human engineering problems relating to the scheme are discussed.cacm august 1974evans a jr.kantrowitz w.weiss e.operating system security security authentication,passwords one-way encryption cryptology4.39 5.39ca740802 jb january 17 1978 10:19 am2622 5 26222622 5 26222622 5 2622
