further evidence for the analysis of algorithmsfor the zero-one programming problemthe purpose of this note is to report computationalexperience additional to that recently summarized by gue et al with two algorithms for thezero-one linear programming problem an error in gue's paper is corrected the utility of one ofthe algorithms as a suboptimizer is indicated.cacm january 1971proll l g.operations research integer programming zero-one variables algorithms5.39 5.41ca710108 jb february 8 1978 10:32 am2226 4 22262226 4 22261658 5 22261666 5 22262226 5 22262226 5 22262226 5 2226
