symbolic factoring of polynomials in several variablesan algorithm for finding the symbolic factors ofa multi-variate polynomial with integer coefficients is presented the algorithm is an extension of a techniqueused by kronecker in a proof that the prime factoring of any polynomial may be found in a finite numberof steps the algorithm consists of factoring single-variable instances of the given polynomial bykronecker's method and introducing the remaining variables by interpolation techniques for implementing thealgorithm and several examples are discussed the algorithm promises sufficient power to be used efficientlyin an online system for symbolic mathematics.cacm august 1966jordan d e.kain r y.clapp l c.ca660812 jb march 2 1978 7:06 pm1396 5 13861386 5 13861386 5 13861386 5 1386964 6 13861028 6 13861029 6 13861083 6 13861132 6 13861214 6 13861278 6 13861334 6 13861365 6 13861386 6 13861387 6 13861388 6 13861392 6 13861393 6 13861394 6 13861395 6 13861396 6 13861397 6 13861496 6 1386284 6 1386407 6 13863199 6 13863200 6 13863201 6 13863202 6 13863203 6 13863204 6 1386561 6 1386730 6 1386
