optimizing bit-time computer simulationa major component of a bit-time computer simulationprogram is the boolean compiler the compiler accepts the boolean functions representing the simulated computer'sdigital circuits and generates corresponding sets of machine instructions which are subsequentlyexecuted on the host computer techniques are discussed for increasing the sophistication of the booleancompiler so as to optimize bit-time computer simulation the techniques are applicable to any general-purpose computer.cacm november 1963katz,j h.ca631114 jb march 13 1978 3:34 pm678 4 6781030 5 678270 5 6781886 5 6781939 5 678678 5 678678 5 678678 5 6781030 6 678678 6 678678 6 678678 6 678
