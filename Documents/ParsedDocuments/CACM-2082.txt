syntax-directed documentation for pl 360the language pl 360 together with its phrase structure grammar is used as a concrete basis for illustrating an idea called syntax-directed documentation this idea is 1 to use the phrase structure of a program to define the structure of a formal documentation for that program 2 to use the syntactic types and identifiers in the resulting structure to trigger the automaticformation of questions to the programmer whose answers willbecome part of that documentation and 3 to provide automatic storageand retrieval facilities so that other programmers who wantto understand or modify the program can access the resulting documentation,which is cross-indexed in various ways by syntactic typesand objects a small pl 360 program already foundin the literature is worked out as an example.cacm april 1970mills h d.documentation syntax analysis pl 360 enforced documentation,indexed documentation automatic interrogation,phase structured grammar syntax-directed documentation syntax processing3.59 3.79 4.19 4.43ca700402 jb february 13 1978 3:28 pm1542 4 20821683 4 20821693 4 20821781 4 20821787 4 20821836 4 20821945 4 20822060 4 20822061 4 20822082 4 20822082 4 20822091 4 20822152 4 20822179 4 20822340 4 20822356 4 20822546 4 20822603 4 20822698 4 20822708 4 20822824 4 20822982 4 20822986 4 20823045 4 20823093 4 20821491 5 20822082 5 20822082 5 20822082 5 20822314 5 2082518 5 20821098 6 20821626 6 20822082 6 20822148 6 2082
