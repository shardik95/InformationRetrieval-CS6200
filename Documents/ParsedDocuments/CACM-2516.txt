hierarchical storage in information retrievala probabilistic analysis is employed to determinethe effect of hierarchical storage organizations on information retrieval operations the data storagehardware is assumed to consist on n-levels of linearly connected memory hardware with increasing dataaccess times and increasing data storage capabilities a system might for example consist of fast semiconductormemory computer core memory extended core storage disk memory and data cells equations are derivedto predict the effect of such a system on data access times using sequential files random access files,and structured files employing multiple-hierarchical linked lists.cacm may 1973salasin j.information retrieval hierarchical storage3.70 3.72 3.73 3.74 3.79 3.90 6.20 6.34ca730504 jb january 24 1978 8:48 am2516 5 25162516 5 25162516 5 2516
