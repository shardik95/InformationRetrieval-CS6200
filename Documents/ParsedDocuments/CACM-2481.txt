the distribution of a program in primary and fast buffer storagea virtual memory computer system with a fastbuffer cache memory between primary memory and the central processing unit is considered the optimaldistribution of a program between the buffer and primary memory is studied using the program's lifetimefunction expressions for the distribution of a program which maximizes the useful fraction ofthe cost-time integral of primary and fast buffer storage are obtained for swapping and nonswapping buffer management policies.cacm july 1973gelenbe e.cache virtual memory lifetime function cost-time integral fast buffer4.3 6.2 6.3ca730705 jb january 23 1978 12:41 pm2374 4 24812481 4 24812669 4 24812863 4 24813016 4 24813052 4 24811901 5 24812481 5 24812481 5 24812481 5 2481
