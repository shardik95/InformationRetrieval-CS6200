file structures using hashing functionsa general method of file structuring is proposed which uses a hashingfunction to define tree structure two types of such trees are examined and their relation to trees studied in the past is explainedesults for the probability distributions of path lengths are derived and illustrated.cacm july 1970coffman jr e g.eve j.data structures tree structures file structures scattertables hashing functions information retrieval3.70 3.74ca700705 jb february 13 1978 8:49 am1050 4 20321676 4 20321682 4 20321728 4 20321860 4 20321935 4 20321936 4 20321973 4 20322017 4 20322018 4 20322032 4 20322032 4 20322033 4 20322107 4 20322109 4 20322203 4 20322251 4 20322257 4 20322360 4 20322359 4 20322451 4 20322452 4 20322524 4 20322543 4 20322552 4 20322559 4 20322991 4 20323053 4 20321785 5 20322032 5 20322032 5 20322032 5 2032849 5 2032
