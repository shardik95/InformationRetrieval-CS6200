a modification of warshall's algorithm forthe transitive closure of binary relationsan algorithm is given for computing the transitiveclosure of a binary relation that is represented by a boolean matrix the algorithm is similar to warshall'salthough it executes faster for sparse matriceson most computers particularly in a paging environment.cacm april 1975warren h s jr.warshall's algorithm transitive closure reachabilitymatrix directed graph digraph boolean matrix binary relation5.30 5.32ca750408 jb january 9 1978 3:49 pm1151 4 27691265 4 27692769 4 27692769 5 27692769 5 27692769 5 2769635 5 2769
