analysis of the pff replacement algorithm via a semi-markov modelan analytical model is presented to estimatethe performance of the page fault frequency pff replacement algorithm in this model program behavioris represented by the lru stack distance model and the pff replacement algorithm is represented by a semi-markovmodel using these models such parameters as the inter-page-fault interval distribution theprobability of the number of distinct pages being referenced during an inter-page-fault interval etc areable to be analytically determined using these models to evaluate these parameter values permits studyof the performance of the replacement algorithm by simulating the page fault events rather than everypage reference event this significantly reduces the required computation time in estimatingthe performance of the pff algorithm.cacm may 1976chu w w.opderbeck h.pff replacement algorithm semi-markovmodel simulation of replacement algorithm4.31 4.32ca760509 jb january 4 1978 2:59 pm1892 4 28621924 4 28622095 4 28622218 4 28622297 4 28622374 4 28622526 4 28622667 4 28622668 4 28622862 4 28622863 4 28621728 5 28622862 5 28622862 5 28622862 5 2862
