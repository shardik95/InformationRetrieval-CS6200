variable-precision exponentiationa previous paper presented an efficient algorithm,called the recomputation algorithm for evaluating a rational expression to within any desired toleranceon a computer which performs variable-precision arithmetic operations the recomputation algorithm can beapplied to expressions involving any variable-precision operations having o(10^p  sum{ei error bounds,where p denotes the operation's precision and ei denotes the error in the operation's ith argument this paper presents an efficient variable-precision exponential operation with an error bound of the aboveorder other operations such as log sin and cos which have simple series expansions can be handled similarly.cacm january 1973richman p l.variable-precision exponential function,error analysis interval arithmetic5.11ca730106 jb january 24 1978 4:32 pm2555 4 25552605 4 25552286 5 25552555 5 25552555 5 25552555 5 2555
