a stochastic approach to the grammatical coding of englisha computer program is described which willassign each word in an english text to its form class or part of speech the program operates at relativelyhigh speed in only a limited storage space about half of the word-events in a corpus are identifiedthrough the use of a small dictionary of function words and frequently occurring lexical words some suffixtests and logical-decision rules are employed to code additional words finally the remaining wordsare assigned to one class or another on the basis of the most probable form classes to occur within the alreadyidentified contexts the conditional probabilities used as a basis for this coding were empirically derivedfrom a separate hand-coded corpusn preliminary trials the accuracy of the coder was 91 to 93 withobvious ways of improving the algorithm being suggested by an analysis of the results.cacm june 1965stolz w s.tannenbaum h.carstensen f v.ca650620 jb march 6 1978 9:35 pm1235 5 12351235 5 12351235 5 1235
