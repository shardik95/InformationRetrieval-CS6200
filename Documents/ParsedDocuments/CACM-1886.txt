generation of optimal code for expressions via factorizationgiven a set of expressions which are to becompiled methods are presented for increasing the efficiency of the object code produced by first factoringthe expressions i.e finding a set of subexpressions each of which occurs in two or more other expressionsor subexpressions once all the factors have been ascertained a sequencing procedure is applied whichorders the factors and expressions such that all information is computed in the correct sequence and factorsneed be retained in memory a minimal amount of time an assignment algorithm is then executed inorder to minimize the total number of temporary storage cells required to hold the results of evaluatingthe factors in order to make these techniques computationally feasible heuristic procedures areapplied and hence global optimal results are not necessarily generated the factorization algorithmsare also applicable to the problem of factoring boolean switching expressions and of factoring polynomialsencountered in symbol manipulating systems.cacm june 1969breuer m a.factorization algorithms code optimization sequencingof operations detection of common subexpressions factorization of boolean expressions4.12 6.1ca690607jb february 17 1978 10:57 am1030 4 18861886 4 18861939 4 18861886 5 18861886 5 18861886 5 18862175 5 1886678 5 18861551 6 18861613 6 18861886 6 1886
