an improved program-synthesizing algorithm and its correctnessan improved program-synthesizing algorithmbased on the algorithm proposed by waldinger and lee in 1969 is given in the old algorithm the program-synthesizingproblem is translated into a theorem-proving problem and a program is obtained by analyzing a proof for the improved algorithm the analysis is not necessary and a program is obtained as soon asthe proof is completed this is achieved by using a modified variable tracing mechanism invented by greenin 1969 the correctness of the improved algorithm is also proved i.e the program thus obtainedalways satisfies the specification.cacm april 1974lee r c t.chang c l.waldinger r j.program-synthesizing algorithms theorem proving,consequence finding primitive resolutions3.60 3.64 4.20 4.42 5.21 5.22 5.24ca740413 jb january 18 1978 9:32 am2657 4 26572719 4 26572210 5 26572657 5 26572657 5 26572657 5 26572719 5 26571626 6 2657210 6 26572151 6 26572167 6 26572210 6 26572645 6 26572657 6 2657
