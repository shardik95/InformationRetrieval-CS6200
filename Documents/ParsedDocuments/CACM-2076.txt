cubic splines on uniform meshesa very simple procedure is presented for constructing cubic splines,periodic or nonperiodic on uniform meshes arcs of two cubics sufficeto construct a basis of cardinal splines an algorithm is given which requires only minimal storage and computation and permits easy trade-off of one against the other.cacm april 1970nilson e n.simple spline representation cardinal splines uniform mesh splines5.13ca700408 jb february 13 1978 2:51 pm2076 5 20762076 5 20762076 5 2076
