modeling and simulation of digital networksthe simulation of digital networks on a digitalcomputer provides the engineer with an effective means of analyzing time-quantized logical behavior thedigital network is modeled as a set of time-dependent or time-independent boolean transformations each transformationdescribing the input-output relationship of a model element comprising the network mode thesimplicity of utilizing the fortran iv programming system as a digital network simulator is discussed anillustrated this simplicity is derived from a common modeling technique applicable to combinationaland sequential digital networks and a systematic programming approach.cacm may 1965larsen r p.mano m m.ca650510 jb march 7 1978 1:15 pm1261 4 12611939 4 12611030 5 12611261 5 12611261 5 12611261 5 1261
