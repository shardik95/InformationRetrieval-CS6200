generation of rosary permutations expressed in hamiltonian circuitssystematic generation of a specific classof permutations fundamental to scheduling problems is described in a nonoriented complete graph withn vertices hamitonian circuits equivalent to 5(n  1 specific permutations of n elements termed rosarypermutations can be defined each of them corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-imageeach other and is generated successively by a number system covering 3*4*n-1 sets of edges every set of edges e[k 1  e[k  k 3  k  n-1 is determined recursively by constructinga hamiltonian circuit with k vertices from a hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices starting withthe hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices the basic operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacentvertices where the position of the pair in the permutation is determined by e[k two algorithmstreating the same example for five vertices are presented it is very easy to derive all possible n!permutations from the 5(n  1  rosary permutations be cycling the permutations and by taking them in thereverse order-procedures which can be performed fairly efficiently by computer cacm june 1971harada k.permutation graph theory scheduling combinatorial algebra5.32 5.39ca710601 jb february 3 1978 1:55 pm2044 4 21892087 4 21892189 4 21892189 4 21892189 4 21892189 4 21892417 4 21892505 4 21892874 4 21892908 4 21893188 4 21891594 5 21892087 5 21892189 5 21892189 5 21892189 5 21892292 5 21892505 5 2189521 5 21893191 5 21892189 6 21892189 6 21892292 6 2189521 6 2189
