stable numerical methods for obtaining the chebyshevsolution to an overdetermined system of equationsan implementation of stiefel's exchange algorithmfor determining a chebyshev solution to an overdetermined system of linear equations is presented,that uses gaussian lu decomposition with row interchanges the implementation is computationally morestable than those usually given in the literature a generalization of stiefel's algorithm is developed whichpermits the occasional exchange of two equations simultaneously.cacm june 1968bartels r h.golub g h.chebyshev solutions overdetermined linearsystems linear equations,exchange algorithm5.13 5.14 5.41ca680601 jb february 22 1978 4:50 pm1744 5 17441744 5 17441744 5 17441905 5 17441744 6 1744
