cold-start vs warm-start miss ratiosin a two-level computer storage hierarchy missratio measurements are often made from a cold start that is made with the first-level store initiallyempty for large capacities the effect on the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred whilefilling the first-level store can be significant even for long reference strings use of warm-start"rather than cold-start miss ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed s-shape oflifetime reciprocal of miss ratio versus capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs thatmaintain a constant number of pages in main storage on the other hand if cold-start miss ratios are measuredas a function of capacity and measurement length then they are useful in studying systems in whichoperation of a program is periodically interrupted by task switches it is shown how to obtain under simpleassumptions the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming from cold-start miss ratio values and how to obtainapproximate cold-start miss ratios from warm-start miss ratios.cacm october 1978easton m.fagin r.miss ratio cold start warm start storage hierarchy,lifetime function multiprogramming s-shape3.70 4.32 9.35ca781009 dh january 29 1979 5:16 pm2374 4 30522481 4 30522669 4 30522863 4 30523016 4 30523052 4 30521901 5 30523052 5 30523052 5 30523052 5 3052
