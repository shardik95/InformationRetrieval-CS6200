an algorithm for class scheduling with section preferencean algorithm for assignment of students to classesin a fixed time schedule that allows students to give a preference for sections within courses is given if consistent with the objective of balanced sections these preferences will be honored the algorithmis more stochastic than monte carlo in nature results are given that compare it to a nonpreference assignment algorithm.cacm september 1967busam v a.ca670906 jb february 27 1978 3:15 pm1540 4 15402209 4 15401434 5 15401540 5 15401540 5 15401540 5 15402052 5 15402209 5 15401008 6 15401013 6 15401434 6 15401504 6 15401540 6 15401540 6 1540
