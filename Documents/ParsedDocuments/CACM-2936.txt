an efficient data structure for the simulation event setrecently algorithms have been presented for therealization of event scheduling routines suitable for general purpose discrete event simulation systems several exhibited a performance superior to that of commonly used simple linked list algorithms in thispaper a new event scheduling algorithm is presented which improves on two aspects of the best of the previouslypublished algorithms first the new algorithm's performance is quite insensitive to skewed distributions,and second its worst-case complexity is o n where n is the number of events in the set furthermore,tests conducted to estimate the average complexity showed it to be nearly independent of n.cacm august 1977franta w r.maly k.simulation time flow mechanisms eventscanning mechanisms multilinked lists3.34 4.22 5.5 8.1ca770807 jb december 28 1977 7:15 am2844 4 29362844 4 29362936 4 29362936 4 29363051 4 29363064 4 29363064 4 29363109 4 29362742 5 29362767 5 29362936 5 29362936 5 29362936 5 29363064 5 29361846 6 29361939 6 29362742 6 29362767 6 29362936 6 2936
