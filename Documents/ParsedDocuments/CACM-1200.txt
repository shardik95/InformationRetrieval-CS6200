on reversible subroutines and computers that run backwardsa computer design is describe which permitssubroutines to be executed backward as well as forward either with their instructions unchanged orreplaced with conjugate instructions it is shown that using this concept a number of new subroutine typescan be developed with rather unusual properties since these properties are analogous to certain matrixoperations a parallel nomenclature is suggested for their classification.cacm september 1965reily e d.federighi f d.ca650906 jb march 6 19787:33 pm1200 5 12001200 5 12001200 5 12001945 5 1200823 6 1200914 6 1200915 6 1200917 6 1200984 6 1200989 6 1200990 6 12001012 6 12001084 6 12001098 6 12001122 6 12001138 6 12001139 6 12001141 6 12001200 6 12001223 6 12001265 6 12001336 6 12001396 6 12001455 6 12001477 6 12001487 6 12001491 6 12001496 6 1200483 6 1200584 6 1200669 6 1200680 6 1200763 6 1200
