concurrent reading and writingthe problem of sharing data among asynchronousprocess is considered it is assumed that only one process at a time can modify the data but concurrentreading and writing is permitted two general theorems are proved and some algorithms are presentedto illustrate their use these include a solution to the general problem in which a read is repeated ifit might have obtained an incorrect result and two techniques for transmitting messages between processes these solutions do not assume any synchronizing mechanism other than data which can be writtenby one process and read by other processes.cacm november 1977lamport l.asynchronous multiprocessing multiprocess synchronization,readers/writers problem shared data4.32 5.24ca771104 jb december 27 1977 7:47 am2320 4 29122597 4 29122777 4 29122851 4 29122895 4 29122912 4 29122946 4 29123128 4 29122150 5 29122912 5 29122912 5 29122912 5 29123128 5 29122150 6 29122376 6 29122436 6 29122597 6 29122865 6 29122866 6 29122870 6 29122912 6 29123082 6 2912
