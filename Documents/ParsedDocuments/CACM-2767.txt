a comparison of simulation event list algorithmsfour algorithms are considered which can be usedto schedule events in a general purpose discrete simulation system two of the algorithms are new oneis based on an end-order tree structure for event notices and another uses an indexed linear list the algorithmsare tested with a set of typical stochastic scheduling distributions especially chosen to showthe advantages and limitations of the algorithms the end-order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous,immediate replacement for the algorithm in use with current simulation languages the mostpromising algorithm uses the indexed list concept it will require an adaptive routine before it canbe employed in general purpose simulators,but its performance is such that further study would be fruitful.cacm april 1975vaucher j g.duval p.simulation time flow mechanisms event list algorithm,simulation time flow mechanisms event list algorithm simulation executive event schedulingroutine discrete system simulation sorting3.74 4.22 8.1ca750410 jb january 9 1978 3:43 pm2767 4 27673064 4 27671939 5 27672767 5 27672767 5 27672767 5 27672844 5 27672936 5 27673051 5 27673064 5 27673109 5 2767970 6 27671059 6 27671846 6 27671939 6 27672742 6 27672742 6 27672742 6 27672767 6 27672767 6 27672767 6 27672767 6 27672767 6 27672844 6 27672844 6 27672936 6 2767
