the use of normal multiplication tablesfor information storage and retrievalthis paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute based information systems using the normal multiplication table as a directoryfor the information system algorithms for the organization and retrieval of information are described this method is particularlysuitable for queries requesting a group of information items all of which possess a particular set of attributes and possiblysome other attributes as well several examples are given theresults with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk spaceare compared to other common approaches algorithms evaluatingthe appropriateness of the above approach to a given information systemare described for a certain class of information systems,the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrievalwith a more economical space requirement than conventional systems moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted file technique.cacm march 1979motzkin d.information retrieval inverted files multiattribute retrieval,multilist file normal multiplication table queries,rapid retrieval space economy3.70 3.73 3.79ca790305 dh may 21 1979 9:46 am2140 4 31342452 4 31342575 4 31342765 4 31342901 4 31342966 4 31343134 4 31343134 4 31343134 4 31343134 4 31341976 5 31342160 5 31342524 5 31342990 5 31343134 5 31343134 5 31343134 5 3134
