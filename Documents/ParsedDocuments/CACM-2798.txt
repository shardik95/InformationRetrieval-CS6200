analysis of interleaved memory systems using blockage buffersa model of interleaved memory systems is presented,and the analysis of the model by monte carlo simulation is discussed the simulations investigatethe performance of various system structures i.e schemes for sending instruction and data requeststo the memory system performance is measured by determining the distribution of the number of memorymodules in operation during a memory cycle an important observation from these investigations is thatseparately grouping instruction and data requests for memory can substantially increase the average numberof memory modules in operation during a memory cycle results of the simulations and an analyticalstudy are displayed for various system structures.cacm february 1975burnett g j.coffman e g jr.interleaved memory systems modular memory systems,memory performance analysis blockage buffer conflict buffer simulation monte carolo simulation5.5 6.34ca750201 jb january 12,1978 8:54 am2798 5 27982798 5 27982798 5 27983119 5 27982245 6 27982798 6 27982849 6 27982859 6 2798
