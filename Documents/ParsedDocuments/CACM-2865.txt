verifying properties of parallel programs an axiomatic approachan axiomatic method for proving a numberof properties of parallel programs is presented hoare has given a set of axioms for partial correctness,but they are not strong enough in most cases this paper defines a more powerful deductive system whichis in some sense complete for partial correctness a crucial axiom provides for the use of auxiliary variables,which are added to a parallel program as an aid to proving it correct the information in a partialcorrectness proof can be used to prove such properties as mutual exclusion freedom from deadlock,and program termination techniques for verifying these properties are presented and illustrated byapplication to the dining philosophers problem.cacm may 1976owicki s.gries d.structured multiprogramming correctness proofs programverification concurrent processes synchronization mutual exclusion deadlock4.32 4.35 5.21 5.24ca760506 jb january 4 1978 3:23 pm2021 4 28652222 4 28652227 4 28652315 4 28652326 4 28652470 4 28652732 4 28652865 4 28652865 4 28652866 4 28652896 4 28652898 4 28652943 4 28652972 4 28653014 4 28653043 4 28653068 4 28653077 4 28653128 4 28653143 4 28653144 4 28651834 5 28652597 5 28652865 5 28652865 5 28652865 5 28653128 5 28653148 5 28651860 6 28652150 6 28652376 6 28652436 6 28652597 6 28652817 6 28652865 6 28652865 6 28652866 6 28652870 6 28652912 6 28652939 6 28653073 6 28653082 6 2865
