digital data processor for tracking the partially illuminated moon*a study of lunar tracking techniques and fabricationof a breadboard to assess the feasibility of the best technique selected was conducted to definea tracking system for observation of the sight line to the center of a partially illuminated moon thedata processing portion of the system is presented in detail and then described in general are the operationof the tracker head assembly for data readout the operation of the entire system and the effect dataprocessing considerations have on the design of the tracker system the system basically consists ofan optical sensor digital computer and tracker drive mechanism the three system units connectedin cascade comprise the control loop for this application an optical telescope with a radial mechanicalscanning mechanism was used that read out lunar sight line measurement information this informationis sequentially read into a special purpose digital computer that extracts the measurements andcomputes the error signals that drive the tracker to the appropriate attitude.cacm march 1964wilcox h j.ca640324 jb march 10 1978 2:02 am1108 5 11081108 5 11081108 5 1108
