on simulating networks of parallel processesin which simultaneous events may occursome of the problems of simulating discreteevent systems particularly computer systems on a conventional digital computer are dealt with thesystems are assumed to be described as a network of interconnected sequential processes briefly reviewedare the common techniques used to handle such simulations when simultaneous events do not occur canbe ignored or can be handled by simple priority rules following this the problem of dealing with simultaneousevents in separate processes is introduced an abstraction of this problem is developed which admitssolution for a majority of commonly encounteredproblems the technique will either find a method ofsimulating the parallel events or report that none can be found in some of the latter cases it is shownto be possible to find a solution by extending the information available to the solution technique butin many cases the technique becomes computationally unfeasible when the additional information is provided.cacm september 1969parnas d l.simulation parallel processes simultaneous events,picture processing computer system simulation3.19 3.24 4.24 5.9 6.9ca690910 jb february 15 1978 4:21 pm1541 4 18461805 4 18461846 4 18461846 4 18461846 4 18461846 4 18461846 4 18461892 4 18462060 4 18462188 4 18462218 4 18462218 4 18462317 4 18462630 4 18462650 4 18463112 4 18461380 5 18461424 5 18461484 5 18461572 5 18461846 5 18461846 5 18461846 5 1846576 5 18463064 5 18461846 6 18461939 6 18462742 6 18462767 6 18462936 6 1846
