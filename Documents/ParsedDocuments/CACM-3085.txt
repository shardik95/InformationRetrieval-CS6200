an o(n algorithm for determining a near-optimalcomputation order of matrix chain productsthis paper discusses the computation of matrixchain products of the form m1 x m2 x  x mn where mi's are matrices the order in which the matricesare computed affects the number of operations a sufficient condition about the association of thematrices in the optimal order is presented an o(n algorithm to find an order of computation whichtakes less than 25 percent longer than the optimal time topt is also presented in most cases the algorithmyields the optimal order or an order which takes only a few percent longer than topt less than 1 percent on the average)cacm july 1978chin f.approximate algorithm heuristic algorithm,matrix multiplication matrix chain product5.14ca780703 dh february 8 1979 2:46 pm3075 4 30853085 4 30852557 5 30853085 5 30853085 5 30853085 5 3085
