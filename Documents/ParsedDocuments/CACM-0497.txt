further remarks on line segment curve-fitting using dynamic programmingin a recent paper bellman showed how dynamicprogramming could be used to determine the solution to a problem previously considered by stone the problemcomprises the determination given n of the n points of subdivision of a given interval a,b andthe corresponding line segments that give the best least squares fit to a function g(x in the interval bellman confined himself primarily to the analytical derivation suggesting briefly however,how the solution of the equation derived for each particular point of subdivision u(i could be reduced toa discrete search in this paper the computational procedure is considered more fully and the similaritiesto some of stone's equations are indicated it is further shown that an equation for u(i involvingno minimization may be found in addition it is shown how bellman's method may be applied to thecurve-fitting problem when the additional constraints are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve.cacm august 1962gluss b.ca620831 jb march 17 1978 9:19 pm497 4 497867 4 497317 5 497497 5 497497 5 497497 5 497867 5 497317 6 497497 6 497
