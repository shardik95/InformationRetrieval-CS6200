a design for a number theory packagewith an optimized trial division routinea number theory package is described which usesdoubly linked list structures for storing multiprecise integers the package has been coded in ibm's basicassembly language and makes heavy use of the macro language and conditional assembly an optimally codedtrial division routine is also described which can be used to determine the unique factorization of large integers.cacm may 1974wunderlich m c.selfridge j l.number theory package trial division multiprecisearithmetic factorization doubly linked lists pseudoprime3.15ca740505 jb january 17 1978 4:09 pm2648 5 26482648 5 26482648 5 2648
