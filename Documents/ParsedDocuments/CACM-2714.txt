merging with parallel processorsconsider two linearly ordered sets a b a|m,b|n m<n and p p<m parallel processors working synchronously the paper presents an algorithmfor merging a and b with the p parallel processors which requires at most 2[log2 2m+1)3m/p  m/p]log2(n/m steps if n  2^b)m b an integer the algorithm requires at most 2[log2 m+1  m/p]2+b)steps in the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude i.e n=km with k being a constant,the algorithm requires 2[log2 m+1  m/p]3+k steps these performances compare very favorably withthe previous best parallel merging algorithm batcher's algorithm which requires n/p  m+n)2p)log2 msteps in the general case and km/p  k+1)2)m/p)log2 m in the special case where n=km.cacm october 1975gavril f.parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion5.31ca751005 jb january 6 1978 10:50 am2714 4 27143075 4 27142664 5 27142714 5 27142714 5 27142714 5 27143075 5 27142289 6 27142557 6 27142664 6 27142714 6 2714
