implications of structured programming for machine architecturebased on an empirical study of more than 10,000lines of program text written in a goto-less language a machine architecture specifically designed forstructured programs is proposed since assignment call return and if statements together account for93 percent of all executable statements special care is given to ensure that these statements can be implementedefficiently a highly compact instruction encoding scheme is presented which can reduce programsize by a factor of 3 unlike a huffman code which utilizes variable length fields this method usesonly fixed length 1-byte op code and address fields the most frequent instructions consist of asingle 1-byte field as a consequence instruction decoding time is minimized and the machine isefficient with respect to both space and time.cacm march 1978tanenbaum a.machine architecture computer architecture computerorganization instruction set design program characteristics4.12 4.22 4.9 6.21ca780308 jb march 28 1978 12:55 pm2411 4 30052709 4 30052889 4 30052937 4 30052989 4 30053005 4 30053025 4 30053101 4 30052138 5 30053005 5 30053005 5 30053005 5 3005
