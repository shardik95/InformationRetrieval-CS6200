improved event-scanning mechanisms for discrete event simulationsimulation models of large complex real-world"applications have occasionally earned the reputation of eating up hours of computer time thisproblem may be attributed in part to difficulties such as slow stochastic convergence however an additionalproblem lies in the fact that a significant amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future eventsin their proper sequence this paper presents a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanningfuture event lists in discrete event simulations there models are presented all of which improve in effectivenessas the events-list scan problem becomes more burdensome.cacm june 1975wyman f p.discrete event simulation simulation event scanning mechanisms4.34 5.5 8.1ca750611 jb january 9 1978 12:43 pm2742 5 27422742 5 27422742 5 27422844 5 27422936 5 27423064 5 2742970 6 27421059 6 27421846 6 27421939 6 27422742 6 27422742 6 27422742 6 27422767 6 27422767 6 27422767 6 27422936 6 2742
