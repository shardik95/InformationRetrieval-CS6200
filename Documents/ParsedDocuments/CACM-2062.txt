the application of sequential samplingto simulation an example inventory modelfour different sequential sampling procedures are appliedto the analysis of data generated by a computer simulationexperiment with a multi-item inventory model for each procedurethe cost of computer time required to achieve given levels ofstatistical precision is calculated also the cost of computer timeusing comparable fixed sample size methods is calculated thecomputer costs of fixed sample size procedures versussequential sampling procedures are compared.cacm may 1970sasser w e.burdick d s.graham d a.naylor t h.simulation inventory models sequentialsampling models experimental design3.31 3.50 3.54 5.5ca700504 jb february 13 1978 2:11 pm2062 5 20622062 5 20622062 5 2062
