interarrival statistics for time sharing systemsthe optimization of time-shared system performancerequires the description of the stochastic processes governing the user inputs and the program activity this paper provides a statistical description of the user input process in the sdc-arpa general-purposetime-sharing system tss the input process is assumed to be stationary and to be defined by theinterarrival time distribution the data obtained appear to justify satisfactorily the common assumptionthat the interarrival times are serially independent the data do not appear to justify except as a veryrough approximation the usual assumption off an exponential distribution for interarrival time a muchmore satisfactory approximation to the data can be obtained with a biphase or triphase hyperexponential distribution.cacm july 1966coffman e g.wood r c.ca660704 jb march 2 1978 9:45 pm1410 5 14101410 5 14101410 5 14101604 5 14101951 5 14102373 5 14101224 6 14101410 6 14101410 6 14101410 6 14101604 6 14101751 6 14101810 6 14101951 6 14102374 6 1410
