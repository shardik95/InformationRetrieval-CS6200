abstract data types and software validationa data abstraction can be naturally specifiedusing algebraic axioms the virtue of these axioms is that they permit a representation-independentformal specification of a data type an example is given which shows how to employ algebraic axioms atsuccessive levels of implementation the major thrust of the paper is twofold first it is shown howthe use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify the process of proving the correctness of an implementationof an abstract data type second semi-automatic tools are described which can be used both to automatesuch proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate implementation from the axioms this implementationallows for limited testing of programs at design time before a conventional implementation is accomplished.cacm december 1978guttag j.horowitz e.musser d.abstract data type correctness proof,data type data structure specification 4.34 5.24ca781208 dh january 18 1979 2:51 pm 3030 4 30313031 4 30313031 4 30313049 4 30313105 4 30313148 4 30313150 4 30312939 5 30312958 5 30313031 5 30313031 5 30313031 5 3031
