significant event simulationthis paper compares a new method of simulationorganization called the significant event method with an old one called the clock pulse method usingas examples two automobile traffic models the significant event method is found to be more efficientthan the clock pulse method at low levels of system interaction and less efficient at high levels a simplemathematical model for the trade-off in the relative running time of the two methods is developed the model aids in choosing between the two simulation methods for a particular experiment it is concludedthat the significant event method can be of value in the simulation of some systems when computationalefficiency is of sufficient importance.cacm june 1975babich a f.grason j.parnas d l.simulation organization event simulation clockpulse simulation significant event simulation.8.1ca750604 jb january 9 1978 1:20 pm2749 5 27492749 5 27492749 5 2749
