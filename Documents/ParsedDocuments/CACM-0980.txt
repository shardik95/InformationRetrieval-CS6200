multiple-precision arithmetic and the exactcalculation of the 3-j 6-j and 9-j symbolsdescribed in this paper is a system of general-purposemultiple-precision fixed-point routines and their use in subroutines which calculate exactlythe quantum-mechanical 3-j 6-j and 9-j symbols of large arguments.cacm november 1964maer r m.redlich m g.ca641103 jb march 9 1978 4:13 pm980 5 980980 5 980980 5 980
