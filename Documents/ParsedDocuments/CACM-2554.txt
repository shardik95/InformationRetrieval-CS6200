reduction of a band-symmetric generalized eigenvalue probleman algorithm is described for reducing thegeneralized eigenvalue problem ax  lambda bx to an ordinary problem in case a and b are symmetric bandmatrices with b positive definite if n is the order of the matrix and m the bandwidth the matricesa and b are partitioned into m-by-m blocks and the algorithm is described in terms of these blocks the algorithm reduces the generalized problem to an ordinary eigenvalue problem for a symmetric bandmatrix c whose bandwidth is the same as a and b the algorithm is similar to those of rutishauser andschwartz for the reduction of symmetric matrices to band form the calculation c requires order mn^2operation the round-off error in the calculation of c is of the same order as the sum of the errors ateach of the n/m steps of the algorithm the latter errors being largely determined by the condition of b with respect to inversion.cacm january 1973crawford c r.generalized eigenvalues symmetric band matrices5.14ca730107 jb january 24 1978 4:26 pm2554 5 25542554 5 25542554 5 2554
