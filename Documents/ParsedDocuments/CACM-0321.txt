algol 60 confidentialthe algol 60 report when first encountered,seems to describe a very complex language which will be difficult to learn the metalinguistic formulae"admirably serve the purpose of precisely specifying a language but they are certainly not very readablefor a beginner however experience has shown that once the report is explained it is in fact easy to learnalgol and to write algorithms in it the language is so general and powerful it can handle an enormousclass of problems it is not hard to learn those parts of algol present in other compiler languages howto write assignment and go to and for statements etc indeed a lot of the unnecessary restrictionsimposed by other compiling languages have finally been lifted but algol also allows many unobvious thingsto be written as we will see later and herein lies a problem algol seems to have become too general so many restrictions have been lifted that a lot of technical details crop up which are hard to learnand to use correctly in this paper some of the more obscure features of the language are consideredand their usefulness is discussed remarks are based on the authors interpretations of the algol 60 report.cacm june 1961knuth d e.merner j n.ca610604 jb march 16 1978 10:48 pm249 4 321254 4 321272 4 3211102 4 3211109 4 3211140 4 3211188 4 3211234 4 3211234 4 3211306 4 3211464 4 3211491 4 3211767 4 3211781 4 3211787 4 3211949 4 321321 4 321321 4 321321 4 321321 4 3212059 4 3212126 4 321435 4 321437 4 321463 4 321483 4 321491 4 3212732 4 321560 4 321583 4 3213073 4 321627 4 321631 4 321632 4 321642 4 321644 4 321653 4 321680 4 321761 4 321762 4 321763 4 321123 4 321140 4 321919 4 321989 4 321196 5 3211234 5 321254 5 321321 5 321321 5 321321 5 321400 5 321401 5 321402 5 321196 6 321944 6 321321 6 321321 6 321385 6 321387 6 321400 6 321402 6 321404 6 3213184 6 321729 6 321
