a comparison of list schedules for parallel processing systemsthe problem of scheduling two or more processorsto minimize the execution time of a program which consists of a set of partially ordered tasksis studied cases where task execution times are deterministic and others in which execution times arerandom variables are analyzed it is shown that different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantlyin execution time and that the b-schedule of coffman and graham is near-optimal a dynamic programmingsolution for the case in which execution times are random variables is presented.cacm december 1974adam t l.chandy k m.dickson j r.parallel processing precedence graphs scheduling,list scheduling optimization dynamic programming4.3 4.32 4.34 4.35 5.3 5.32 5.4 5.42 8.1ca741204 jb january 16 1978 9:42 am2570 5 25702570 5 25702570 5 2570
