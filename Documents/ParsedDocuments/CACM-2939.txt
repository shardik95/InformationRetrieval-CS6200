abstraction mechanisms in cluclu is a new programming language designed to supportthe use of abstractions in program construction work in programming methodology has led to the realizationthat three kinds of abstractions-procedural control and especially data abstractions-are usefulin the programming process of these only the procedural abstraction is supported well by conventionallanguages through the procedure or subroutine clu provides in addition to procedures novel linguisticmechanisms that support the use of data and control abstractions this paper provides an in troductionto the abstraction mechanisms in clu by means of programming examples the utility of the threekinds of abstractions in program construction is illustrated and it is shown how clu programs maybe written to use and implement abstractions the clu library which permits incremental program developmentwith complete type checking performed at compile time is also discussed.cacm august 1977liskov b.snyder a.atkinson r.schaffert c.programming languages data types data abstractions,control abstractions programming methodology separate compilation4.0 4.12 4.20 4.22ca770804 jb december 28 1977 7:49 am2319 4 29392480 4 29392594 4 29392709 4 29392868 4 29392939 4 29392939 4 29392941 4 29392972 4 29393155 4 29392204 5 29392558 5 29392939 5 29392939 5 29392939 5 29393031 5 29393105 5 29393148 5 29393150 5 29391471 6 29391860 6 29392060 6 29392625 6 29392632 6 29392704 6 29392817 6 29392842 6 29392865 6 29392868 6 29392939 6 29392939 6 29392939 6 29392939 6 29392940 6 29392941 6 29392943 6 29392958 6 29393068 6 29393073 6 29393073 6 29393148 6 2939
