on programming the numerical solution of polynomial equationsnumerical techniques are presented for computingthe roots of polynomial equations by applying the recommended scaling and inversion rules the basicbairstow and newton-raphson iterative techniques can be applied with great reliability both a high degreeof accuracy and rapid convergence are realized numerical examples are shown to illustrate the pitfallsand to show how these are circumvented by application of the recommended procedures.cacm december 1960ellenberger k w.ca601205 jb march 20 1978 6:41 pm111 5 111111 5 111111 5 111
