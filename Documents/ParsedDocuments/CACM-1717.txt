generating prime implicants via ternary encoding and decimal arithmeticdecimal arithmetic ternary encoding of cubes,and topological considerations are used in an algorithm to obtain the extremals and prime implicantsof boolean functions the algorithm which has been programmed in the fortran language generally requiresless memory than other minimization procedures and treats don't care terms in an efficient manner.cacm july 1968dietmeyer d l.duley j r.prime implicants extremal switching function,minimization cubical complexes ternary encoding3.24 6.1ca680712 jb february 22 1978 11:30 am1717 5 17171717 5 17171717 5 1717
