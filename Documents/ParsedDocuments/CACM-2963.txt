a fast algorithm for computing longest common subsequencespreviously published algorithms for findingthe longest common subsequence of two sequences of length n have had a best-case running time of o(n^2 an algorithm for this problem is presented which has a running time of o(r  n)log n where ris the total number of ordered pairs of positions at which the two sequences match thus in the worstcase the algorithm has a running time of o(n^2 log n however for those applications where most positionsof one sequence match relatively few positions in the other sequence a running time of o(n log n can be expected.cacm may 1977hunt j w.szymanski t g.longest common subsequence efficient algorithms3.73 3.63 5.25ca770509 jb december 29 1977 1:46 am2963 4 29633114 4 29632745 5 29632963 5 29632963 5 29632963 5 2963
