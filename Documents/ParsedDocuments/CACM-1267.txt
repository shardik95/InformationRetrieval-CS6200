performance of systems used for data transmissiontransfer rate of information bits an asa tutorial standardinformation thruput as a characteristic ofsystems performance is discussed this discussion includes the pertinent aspects of information transfer,of determination of transfer rate of information bits trib of residual errors and of standard measurementconditions the paper also presents an orderly arrangement of characteristics and parametersthat affect information thruput and some examples on procedures for determining a thruput rate in terms oftrib it concludes that a performance characteristic involving information rate can best be expressed as thetrib in conjunction with the residual error rate.cacm may 1965ca650504 jb march 7 1978 3:10 pm1267 5 12671267 5 12671267 5 1267
