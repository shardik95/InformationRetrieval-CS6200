certification of programs for secure information flowthis paper presents a certification mechanismfor verifying the secure flow of information through a program because it exploits the propertiesof a lattice structure among security classes the procedure is sufficiently simple that it can easilybe included in the analysis phase of most existing compilers appropriate semantics are presented andproved correct an important application is the confinement problem the mechanism can prove that a programcannot cause supposedly nonconfidential results to depend on confidential input data.cacm july 1977denning d e.denning p j.protection security information flow program certification,lattice confinement security classes4.3 4.35 5.24ca770707 jb december 28 1977 8:48 am1807 4 29452034 4 29452290 4 29452579 4 29452923 4 29452945 4 29452945 4 29452945 4 29453128 4 29453150 4 29451947 5 29452704 5 29452870 5 29452945 5 29452945 5 29452945 5 2945
