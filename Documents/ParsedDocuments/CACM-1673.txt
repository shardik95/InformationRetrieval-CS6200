approximate solution of initial boundary waveequation problems by boundary-value techniquesa new boundary-value technique is proposed forthe treatment of initial-boundary-value problems for linear and mildly nonlinear wave equations severalillustrative examples are offered to demonstrate the ease with which the method can be applied.cacm november 1968greenspan d.initial-boundary-value problem wave equation boundary-value technique5.15 5.17ca681106 jb february 21 1978 2:48 pm1673 5 16731673 5 16731673 5 1673
