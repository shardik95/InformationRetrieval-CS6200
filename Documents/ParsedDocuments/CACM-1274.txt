on the numerical solution of an n-point boundaryvalue problem for linear ordinary differential equationsa method for the numerical solution of then-pointboundary value problem for homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations is developed themethod requires two runge-kutta integrations over the interval under consideration and the solution ofa linear system of equations with n-1 unknowns.cacm april 1965day j t.ca650417 jb march 7 1978 3:30 pm1274 4 12741147 5 12741274 5 12741274 5 12741274 5 1274
