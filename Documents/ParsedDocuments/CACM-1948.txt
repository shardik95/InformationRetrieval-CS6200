computers in group theory a surveycomputers are being applied to an increasinglydiverse range of problems in group theory the most important areas of application at present arecoset enumeration subgroup lattices automorphism groups of finite groups character tables and commutatorcalculus group theory programs range from simple combinatorial or numerical programs to largesymbol manipulation systems in this survey the more important algorithms in use are described and contrasted,and results which have been obtained using existing programs are indicated an extensive bibliography is included.cacm january 1969cannon j j.group theory coset enumeration subgroup lattices,automorphism groups character tables commutator calculus topology crystallography permutation groups,abelian groups discrete mathematics non-numerical programming symbol manipulation survey1.3 3.15 5.39ca690101 jb february 20 1978 1:27 pm1567 4 19481948 4 19481948 4 19481391 5 19481559 5 19481948 5 19481948 5 19481948 5 1948
