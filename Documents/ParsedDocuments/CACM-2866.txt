proving monitorsinteresting scheduling and sequential propertiesof monitors can be proved by using state variables which record the monitor's history and by defining extendedproof rules for their wait and signal operations these two techniques are defined discussed and appliedto examples to prove properties such as freedom from indefinitely repeated overtaking or unnecessary waitingupper bounds on queue lengths and historical behavior.cacm may 1976howard j.monitors correctness proof rules historical variables,concurrency scheduling bounded buffer semaphores alarm clock disk head4.32 4.35 5.24ca760505 jb january 4 1978 3:28 pm2704 4 28662738 4 28662865 4 28662866 4 28662866 4 28662866 4 28662869 4 28662898 4 28662941 4 28662958 4 28662972 4 28663004 4 28663030 4 28663043 4 28663128 4 28663144 4 28662356 5 28662597 5 28662796 5 28662866 5 28662866 5 28662866 5 28662938 5 28662946 5 28663128 5 28662150 6 28662150 6 28662376 6 28662436 6 28662597 6 28662865 6 28662866 6 28662866 6 28662866 6 28662870 6 28662912 6 28663082 6 2866
