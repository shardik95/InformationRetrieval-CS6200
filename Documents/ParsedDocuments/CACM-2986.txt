operations on sparse relationsvarious computations on relations boolean matrices,or directed graphs such as the computation of precedence relations for a context-free grammar can bedone by a practical algorithm that is asymptotically faster than those in common use for example how to computeoperator precedence or wirth-weber precedence relations in o(n^2 steps is shown as well as how tocompute linear precedence functions in o(n^2 steps is shown as well as how to compute linear precedencefunctions in o(n steps where n is the size of a grammer the heart of the algorithms is a generaltheorem giving sufficient conditions under which an expression whose operands are sparse relations andwhose operators are composition transitive closure union and inverse can be computed efficiently.cacm march 1977hunt h b iiiszymanski t g.ullman j d.computational complexity sparse relation booleanmatrix directed graph wirth-weber precedence relation linear precedence function slrgrammar t-canonical precedence relation4.12 5.23 5.25ca770306 jb december 29 1977 8:05 am1542 4 29861683 4 29861693 4 29861781 4 29861787 4 29861836 4 29861945 4 29862060 4 29862061 4 29862082 4 29862091 4 29862152 4 29862179 4 29862221 4 29862340 4 29862340 4 29862340 4 29862356 4 29862546 4 29862603 4 29862698 4 29862708 4 29862733 4 29862824 4 29862824 4 29862824 4 29862982 4 29862982 4 29862982 4 29862986 4 29862986 4 29862986 4 29862986 4 29862986 4 29863045 4 29863093 4 29863093 4 29863094 4 29861491 5 29861683 5 29861836 5 29862179 5 29862340 5 29862986 5 29862986 5 29862986 5 2986
