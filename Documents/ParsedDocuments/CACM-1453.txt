a nonrecursive method of syntax specificationthe use of the kleene regular expression notationfor describing algebraic language syntax in particular of algol is described in this paper a fortran ii computer program for carrying out the elimination algorithm of gorn,similar to gaussian eliminationfor linear systems of algebraic equations is described this was applied to numerous smallerlanguages including some sublanguage of algol a hand calculation result of the application of the algorithmto all of algol is given thus expressing the revised algol 1960 syntax in completely nonrecursiveterms as far as its context-free portion is concerned this description in many ways is far moreintuitively understood than the previous recursive description it is suggested the paper also includesresults of the machine program which does not include a simplification algorithm.cacm april 1966carr iii j w.weiland j.ca660402 jb march 3 1978 11:02 am1086 4 14531132 4 14531234 4 14531263 4 14531263 4 14531265 4 14531270 4 14531323 4 14531358 4 14531379 4 14531380 4 14531453 4 14531453 4 14531464 4 14531484 4 14531491 4 14531498 4 14531613 4 14531614 4 14531781 4 14531825 4 14531860 4 14531945 4 14532083 4 14532178 4 14532179 4 14532252 4 14532325 4 14532341 4 14532546 4 14532645 4 14532652 4 14532684 4 14532842 4 14532929 4 14532934 4 14533069 4 1453669 4 1453679 4 1453691 4 1453761 4 1453949 4 1453989 4 1453989 5 14531453 5 14531453 5 14531453 5 14531613 5 14533184 5 1453987 6 14531086 6 14531134 6 14531453 6 14533184 6 1453
