multiple precision floating-point conversionfrom decimal-to-binary and vice versadecimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal floating-pointconversion is often performed by using a table of the powers 10^i ia positive integer forconverting from base 10 to base 2 and by using a table of the coefficient of a polynomial approximationof 10^x 0<x<1 for converting from base 2 to base 10 these tables occupy a large storage regionin the case of a nonsingle precision conversion this paper shows that a single small table sufficesfor a floating-point conversion from decimal to binary and vice versa in any useful precision.cacm may 1966mancino o g.ca660507 jb march 3 1978 9:56 am1430 5 14301430 5 14301430 5 1430
