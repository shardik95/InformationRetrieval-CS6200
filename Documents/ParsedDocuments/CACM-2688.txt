attribute based file organization in a paged memory environmentthe high cost of page accessing implies a needfor more careful data organization in a paged memory than is typical of most inverted file and similarapproaches to multi-key retrieval this article analyses that cost and proposes a method called multiplekey hashing which attempts to minimize it since this approach is not always preferable to inversion,a combined method is described the exact specifications of this combination for a file with givendata and traffic characteristics is formulated as a mathematical program the proposed heuristic solutionto this program can often improve on a simple inversion technique by a factor of 2 or 3.cacm february,1974rothnie j b jr.lozano t.file organization paging retrieval algorithm,inverted file multiple key hashing3.70 3.73 3.74 3.79ca740201 jb january 18 1978 1:37 pm2160 4 26882688 4 26882114 5 26882688 5 26882688 5 26882688 5 26882976 5 26882688 6 26882765 6 26882882 6 2688
