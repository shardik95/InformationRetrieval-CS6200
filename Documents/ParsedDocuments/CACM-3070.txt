hybrid simulation models of computer systemsthis paper describes the structure and operationof a hybrid simulation model in which both discrete-event simulation and analytic techniques arecombined to produce efficient yet accurate system models in an example based on a simple hypotheticalcomputer system discrete-event simulation is used to model the arrival and activation of jobs and acentral-server queueing network models the use of system processors the accuracy and efficiency of thehybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing the result and computational costs of the hybrid model ofthe example with those of an equivalent simulation-only model cacm september 1978schwetman h.performance evaluation simulation queueingnetwork models central server model4.32 4.35 8.1ca780902 dh february 5 1979 3:32 pm2712 4 30702741 4 30703016 4 30703059 4 30703070 4 30703070 4 30703070 4 30703070 4 30703153 4 30701805 5 30702454 5 30702741 5 30702988 5 30703070 5 30703070 5 30703070 5 3070
