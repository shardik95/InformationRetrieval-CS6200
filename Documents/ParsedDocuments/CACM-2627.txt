scheduling independent tasks to reduce mean finishing timesequencing to minimize mean finishing time(or mean time in system is not only desirable to the user but it also tends to minimize at each pointin time the storage required to hold incomplete tasks in this paper a deterministic model of independenttasks is introduced and new results are derived which extend and generalize the algorithms known forminimizing mean finishing time in addition to presenting and analyzing new algorithms it is shownthat the most general mean-finishing-time problem for independent tasks is polynomial complete and hence unlikelyto admit of a non-enumerative solutioncacm july 1974bruno j.coffman e g jr.sethi r.minimizing mean finishing time minimizing mean flowtime sequencing algorithms optimal scheduling algorithms deterministic scheduling models4.32 5.39ca740704 jb january 17 1978 12:56 pm2627 5 26272627 5 26272627 5 2627
