an alternative to event queues for synchronization in monitorsin the monitor concept as proposed by brinchhansen and hoare event are used for synchronization this paper describes another synchronizing primitivewhich is nearly as expressive as the conditional wait but can be implemented more efficiently an implementationof this primitive in terms of p and v operations is given together with a correctness proof two examples are presented the readers and writers problem and the problem of informationstreams sharing a finite buffer pool.cacm july 1977kessels j l w.monitor operating system mutual exclusion synchronization,conditional critical region structuring concept4.31ca770706 jb december 28 1977 10:10 am2320 4 29462597 4 29462777 4 29462851 4 29462895 4 29462912 4 29462938 4 29462946 4 29462946 4 29463128 4 29463128 4 29462150 5 29462866 5 29462898 5 29462946 5 29462946 5 29462946 5 29462597 6 29462946 6 2946
