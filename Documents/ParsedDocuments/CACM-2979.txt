studies in machine cognition using the game of pokera progress report is presented of on-goingresearch efforts concerning human decision making under uncertainly and risk and human problem solvingand learning processes on the one hand and machine learning large scale programming systems and novelprogramming techniques on the other there has also been in terest in how humans make deductive and inductiveinferences and form and optimize heuristic rules and how machines can reach similar results although the vehicle of these investigations has been the game of poker a conceptual framework has beenprovided that should have a fairly wide range of applicability the models of human judgment choice,and decision making are incorporated in a large scale complex program they represent both descriptiveand normative theories of behavior an in teractive game environment has been recently established which,besides its usefulness for experiments in game playing enables humans to construct machine strategies"on-line in a question answering advice taking mode.cacm april 1977findler n v.machine learning game playing programs decisionmaking under uncertain ty and risk automatic forming and optimizing of heuristic rules automaticinductive and deductive inference making models of game learning poker gambling and bluffing3.36 3.62 3.61 3.64 3.65 3.66ca770403 jb december 29 1977 5:34 am2979 5 29792979 5 29792979 5 2979
