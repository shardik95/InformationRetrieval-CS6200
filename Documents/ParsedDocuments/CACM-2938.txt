toward a discipline of real-time programmingprogramming is divided into three major categorieswith increasing complexity of reasoning in program validation sequential programming multiprogramming,and real-time programming by adhering to a strict programming discipline and by using a suitablehigh-level language molded after this discipline the complexity of reasoning about concurrency and executiontime constrain ts may be drastically reduced this may be the only practical way to make real-timesystems analytically verifiable and ultimately reliable a possible discipline is outlined andexpressed in terms of the language modula.cacm august 1977wirth n.multiprogramming real-time programming process synchronization,processor sharing program validation modula3.80 4.22ca770805 jb december 28 19777:39 am2938 4 29382946 4 29383128 4 29382866 5 29382938 5 29382938 5 29382938 5 2938
