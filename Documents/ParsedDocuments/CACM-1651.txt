an interpretive input routine for linear programmingin this descriptive article an input codeis presented which greatly simplifies data input to any linear programming solution routine for subsequentuse either as a pedagogical device or for solving rather small lp problems this latter limited)use derives not at all from inherent limitations in the code itself but from an efficiency evaluation:large lp problems would doubtless benefit from an input system more suited for bulk data handling thanthe input code described from a user's standpoint input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentationof the lp problem limited only by a keypunch's inability to write subscripts etc the input interpreterscans column wise thus no fixed format data preparation is required the user may also undervery general requirements only liberally use editorial comments throughout the input deck as anaid in identification e.g of row constraints the article includes examples of input output from asolution routine presently in use and a skeleton flowchart of the input interpreter.cacm january 1967aigner d j.ca670104 jb march 1 1978 8:58 am1651 5 16511651 5 16511651 5 1651
