on the stability of gauss-jordan elimination with pivotingthe stability of the gauss-jordan algorithmwith partial pivoting for the solution of general systems of linear equations is commonly regarded as suspect it is shown that in many respects suspicions are unfounded and in general the absolute error in the solutionis strictly comparable with that corresponding to gaussian elimination with partial pivoting plus backsubstitution however when a is ill conditioned the residual corresponding to the gauss-jordan solutionwill often be much greater than that corresponding to the gaussian elimination solution.cacm january 1975peters g.wilkinson j h.gauss-jordan algorithm gaussian elimination back-substitution,backward error analysis bounds for error in solution bound for residual 5.11 5.14ca750104 jb january 12 1978 10:44 am2807 5 28072807 5 28072807 5 2807
