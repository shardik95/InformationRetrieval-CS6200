a model of memory contention in a paging machinethis paper is concerned with certain aspects of contentionfor main memory resources in a multiprogrammed computer system operating under demand paging inthe model presented the number of page-frames of main memory allocated to a problem program varies intime these changes in memory configuration are represented explicitly in the model cpu requirements andpage exception characteristics of program material being described statistically expressions for the distributionof the number of page-frames allocated to an executing program the long run expected fractionof a program's execution time in a given number of page-frames and the average execution interval of themultiprogrammed load are obtained it is pointed out heuristically and demonstrated numerically thatan increase is obtain able in the average execution interval of the multiprogrammed load over that resultingfrom equal fixed partitioning of main memory.cacm august 1972oden p h.shedler g s.paging machines demand paging operating systemsstudies queuing analysis memory contention memory management4.32ca720805 jb january 30 1978 9:50 am1879 4 22971884 4 22971892 4 22971901 4 22971924 4 22972095 4 22972095 4 22972218 4 22972277 4 22972297 4 22972297 4 22972365 4 22972374 4 22972526 4 22972667 4 22972668 4 22972862 4 22972863 4 22971728 5 22971754 5 22972297 5 22972297 5 22972297 5 2297
