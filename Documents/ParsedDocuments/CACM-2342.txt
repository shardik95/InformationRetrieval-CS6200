interference between communicating parallel processesvarious kinds of interference between communicatingparallel processes have been examined by dijkstra knuth and others solutions have been givenfor the mutual exclusion problem and associated subproblems in the form of parallel programs and informalproofs of correctness have been given for these solutions in this paper a system of parallelprocesses is regarded as a machine which proceeds from one state s i.e a collection of pertinent datavalues and process configurations to a next state s in accordance with a transition rule s  s aset of such rules yields sequences of states which dictate the system's behavior the mutual exclusion problemand the associated subproblems are formulated as questions of inclusion between sets of states orof the existence of certain sequences a mechanical proof procedure is shown which will either verify provethe correctness of  or discredit prove the incorrectness of an attempted solution with respectto any of the interference properties it is shown how to calculate transition rules from the partialrules by which the individual processes operate the formation of partial rules and the calculation oftransition rules are both applicable to hardware processes as well as to software processes andsymmetry between processes is not required.cacm june 1972gilbert p.chandler w j.concurrent programming control cooperating processes,formal programs interference mutual exclusion operating systems parallel processes4.0 4.10 4.30 4.32 4.42 5.24 6.20ca720603 jb january 31 1978 8:44 am1781 4 23421828 4 23421854 4 23421877 4 23421960 4 23422150 4 23422150 4 23422150 4 23422228 4 23422228 4 23422256 4 23422256 4 23422317 4 23422317 4 23422319 4 23422377 4 23422342 4 23422342 4 23422342 4 23422376 4 23422376 4 23422379 4 23422424 4 23422482 4 23422618 4 23422618 4 23422618 4 23422632 4 23422704 4 23422723 4 23422738 4 23422740 4 23422741 4 23422867 4 23423184 4 23423184 4 23421198 5 23421338 5 23421749 5 23422342 5 23422342 5 23422342 5 2342
