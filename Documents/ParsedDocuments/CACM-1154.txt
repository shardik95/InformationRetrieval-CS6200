multi-tape and infinite-state automata  a surveya survey of machines which are more powerfulthan finite automata and less powerful than general turing machines is presented it is felt that the machinesin this category are as closely related to digital computers as either the finite automata or theunrestricted turing machines intermediate machines can be created by adjoining on infinite-state memoryto a finite-state machine and then performing any or all of the following 1 restrict the manner inwhich the unbounded portion of the memory can be accessed 2 bound the number of steps allowed for acomputation by some increasing recursive function of the length of the input 3 restrict the total amountof memory available in the same manner examples from all three classes and their properties are discussed.cacm december 1965fischer p c.ca651215 jb march 6 1978 3:24 pm1154 5 11541154 5 11541154 5 1154
