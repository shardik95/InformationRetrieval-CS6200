compressed triesthis paper presents a new data structure,called a compressed trie or c-trie to be used in information retrieval systems it has the same underlyingm-ary tree structure as a trie where m is a parameter of the trie but whereas the fields of thenodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold a key or at least a pointer the fields in a c-trie areonly one bit long in the analysis part of the paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys theretrieval time measured in terms of bit inspections of one key is of the order logm(n and the storagerequirement of the order n*m+log2 n bits this improvement in storage requirements and retrieval timeis achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility of the structure and therefore updating costs are increased first the c-trie is analyzed as a data structure and then several methods of its usefor relatively static databases are discussed.cacm july 1976maly k.data structure database m-ary tree trie,retrieval time storage requirement keys3.70 3.74 3.75ca760707 jb january 4 1978 12:26 pm2846 4 2846849 4 2846944 4 2846155 5 28462846 5 28462846 5 28462846 5 28463041 5 28462846 6 28462905 6 2846
