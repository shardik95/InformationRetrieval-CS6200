use of the hough transformation todetect lines and curves in pictureshough has proposed an interesting and computationallyefficient procedure for detecting lines in pictures this paper points out that the use of angle-radiusrather than slope-intercept parameters simplifies the computation further it also showshow the method can be used for more general curve fitting and gives alternative interpretationsthat explain the source of its efficiency.cacm january 1972duda r o.hart p e.picture processing pattern recognition line detection,curve detection colinear points point-line transformation hough transformation3.63ca720103 jb february 1 1978 9:36 am2400 5 24002400 5 24002400 5 24002788 5 24002910 5 24002400 6 24002400 6 24002788 6 2400
