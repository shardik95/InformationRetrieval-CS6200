analysis of the availability of computersystems using computer aided algebraanalytical results related to the availabilityof a computer system constructed of unreliable processors are presented in this paper these resultsare obtained by using various computer-aided algebraic manipulation techniques a major purpose ofthis paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties of obtaining analytical solutions to markov processescan be considerably reduced by the application of symbol manipulation programs since many physicalsystems can be modeled by markov and semi-markov processes the potential range of application of these techniquesis much wider than the problem of availability analyzed here.cacm july 1978chattergy r.pooch u.computer-aided algebra symbol manipulation markovprocess reliability redundant structures on-line computer system.3.82 5.5 5.7 8.1 8.3ca780710 dh february 7 1979 3:37 pm3078 5 30783078 5 30783078 5 3078
