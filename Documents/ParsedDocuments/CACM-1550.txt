a comparison of batch processing and instant turnarounda study of the programming efforts of studentsin an introductory programming course is presented and the effects of having instant turnaround a few minutes)as opposed to conventional batch processing with turnaround times of a few hours are examined amongthe items compared are the number of computer runs per trip to the computation center program preparationtime keypunching time debugging time number of runs and elapsed time from the first runto the last run on each problem even though the results are influenced by the fact that bonus points"were given for completion of a programming problemin less than a specified number of runs thereis evidence to support instant over batch"cacm august 1967smith l b.ca670805 jb february 27 1978 4:32 pm1550 4 15501550 4 15501304 5 15501472 5 15501550 5 15501550 5 15501550 5 15501908 5 15501550 6 15501605 6 1550
