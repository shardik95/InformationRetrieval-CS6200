the choice of reference poin ts in best-match file searchingimprovements to the exhaustive search methodof best-match file searching have previously been achieved by doing a preprocessing step involving thecalculation of distances from a reference poin t this paper discusses the proper choice of referencepoin ts and extends the previous algorithm to use more than one reference poin t it is shown that referencepoin ts should be located outside of data clusters the results of computer simulations are presented whichshow that large improvements can be achieved by the proper choice and location of multiple reference poin ts.cacm may 1977shapiro m.matching file searching best match nearest-neighbor classification3.73 3.74ca770506 jb december 29 1977 1:57 am2575 4 29662966 4 29663134 4 29662524 5 29662966 5 29662966 5 29662966 5 2966
