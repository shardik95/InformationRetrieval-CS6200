bliss a language for systems programminga language bliss is described this languageis designed so as to be especially suitable for use in writing production software systems for aspecific machine the pdp-10 compilers operating systems etc prime design goals of the design are theability to produce highly efficient object code to allow access to all relevant hardware features ofthe host machine and to provide a rational means by which to cope with the evolutionary nature of systemsprograms a major feature which contributes to the realization of these goals is a mechanism permittingthe definition of the representation of all data structures in terms of the access algorithm for elements of the structure.cacm december 1971wulf w a.russell d b.programming languages implementation language,systems programming data structures4.12 4.21 4.22ca711205 jb february 2 1978 10:09 am1973 4 21381992 4 21382138 4 21382203 4 21382251 4 21382530 4 21382537 4 21382543 4 21382559 4 21382573 4 21382991 4 21383053 4 21383083 4 21382107 5 21382138 5 21382138 5 21382138 5 21382411 5 21382709 5 21382889 5 21382937 5 21382989 5 21383005 5 21383025 5 21383101 5 21381069 6 21381425 6 21382138 6 21382138 6 21382138 6 21382138 6 21382138 6 21382138 6 21382138 6 21382138 6 21382193 6 21382204 6 21382326 6 21382388 6 21382438 6 21382456 6 21382455 6 21382477 6 21382989 6 21383185 6 2138
