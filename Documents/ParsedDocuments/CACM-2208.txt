storage utilization in a memory hierarchy when storageassignment is performed by a hashing algorithmthe utilization of storage is studied in a two-levelmemory hierarchy the first storage level which is the fast store is divided into a number ofstorage areas when an entry is to be filed in the hierarchy a hashing algorithm will attempt toplace the entry into one of these areas if this particular area is full then the entry will be placedinto the slower second-level store even though other areas in the first-level store may have spaceavailable given the n entries have been filed in the entire hierarchy an expression is derived for theexpected number of entries filed in the first-level storehis expression gives a measure of how effectivelythe first-level store is being used by means of examples storage utilization is then studied as afunction of the hashing algorithm the number of storage areas into which the first-level store is dividedand the total size of the first-level store cacm march 1971williams j g.hashing algorithms memory allocation memory hierarchy,memory utilization storage allocation storage hierarchy storage utilization3.74 4.3ca710304 jb february 3 1978 4:37 pm2208 5 22082208 5 22082208 5 2208
