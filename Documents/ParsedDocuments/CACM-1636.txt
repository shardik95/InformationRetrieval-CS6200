invariant imbeding and the numerical integrationof boundary-value problems for unstable linear systems of ordinary differential equationsin such diverse areas as radiative transferin planetary atmospheres and optimal guidance and control two-point boundary-value problems for unstablesystems arise greatly complicating the numerical solution an invariant imbeding technique is presentedwhich is useful in overcoming these frequently encountered instabilities and the resultsof some numerical experiments are given.cacm february 1967belman r e.kagiwada h h.kalaba r e.ca670206 jb february 28 1978 3:28 pm1636 5 16361636 5 16361636 5 16362427 5 16361581 6 16361636 6 1636
