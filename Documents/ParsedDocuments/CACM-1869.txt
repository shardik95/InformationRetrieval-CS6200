block structures indirect addressing and garbage collectionprogramming languages have included explicitor implicit block structures to provide a naming convenience for the programmer however when indirectaddressing is used as in snobol naming constraints may be introduced two modifications to snobol are described,resulting in two desirable consequences 1 naming constraints disappear even when there isindirect addressing within function definitions and 2 there is a significant saving in the number ofcalls to the garbage collector because some garbage is collected at little expense each time a functionreturns to its calling program these modifications have been implemented as an extension to a snobol dialect.cacm july 1969kain r y.block structures indirect addressing,garbage collection local names snobol4.22ca690711 jb february 15 1978 6:49 pm1869 4 18691869 4 18692513 4 18692665 4 18692723 4 18692855 4 18693106 4 18691549 5 18691570 5 18691869 5 18691869 5 18691869 5 18692060 5 18692770 5 18691380 6 18691421 6 18691469 6 18691477 6 18691491 6 18691786 6 1869210 6 18691869 6 18691869 6 18691973 6 18691992 6 18692018 6 18692109 6 18692110 6 18692673 6 1869
