computer simulation-discussion of thetechnique and comparison of languages the purpose of this paper is to present a comparisonof some computer simulation languages and of some of the involved in comparing software packagesfor digital computers are discussed in part i the issue is obvious users of digital computersmust choose from available languages or write their own substantial costs can occur particularly in training,implementation and computer time if an inappropriate language is chosenore and more computer simulationlanguages are being developed comparisons and evaluations of existing languages are useful for designersand implementers as well as users the second part is devoted to computer simulation and simulationlanguages the computational characteristics of simulation are discussed with special attention beingpaid to a distinction between continuous and discrete change models part iii presents a detailed comparisonof six simulation languages and packages simscript clp csl gasp cpss and sol the characteristics ofeach are summarized in a series of tables the implications of this analysis for designers of languages,for users and for implementers are developed the conclusion of the paper is that the packages nowavailable for computer simulation offer features which none of the more general-purpose packages do andthat analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each suggests ways in which both current and future simulationlanguages and packages can be improved.cacm october 1966teichroew d.lubin j f.ca661001 jb march 2 1978 4:23 pm1366 5 13661366 5 13661366 5 13661503 5 13661781 5 13661860 5 13662091 5 1366123 6 1366196 6 1366919 6 1366990 6 13661007 6 13661046 6 13661131 6 13661139 6 13661140 6 13661149 6 13661198 6 13661215 6 13661223 6 13661265 6 13661303 6 13661323 6 13661358 6 13661366 6 13661366 6 13661366 6 13661366 6 13661389 6 13661421 6 13661421 6 13661460 6 13661462 6 13661463 6 13661467 6 13661468 6 13661477 6 13661477 6 13661491 6 13661491 6 13661496 6 13661496 6 13661531 6 13661535 6 13661565 6 13661601 6 13661602 6 13661613 6 13661614 6 13661626 6 13661626 6 13661641 6 13661641 6 13661785 6 13661786 6 13661787 6 13661788 6 1366205 6 1366224 6 1366249 6 1366288 6 1366316 6 1366378 6 1366381 6 1366398 6 136611 6 1366404 6 1366410 6 1366463 6 1366464 6 1366483 6 13663184 6 13663184 6 13663188 6 1366584 6 1366600 6 1366680 6 1366691 6 1366763 6 1366799 6 1366
