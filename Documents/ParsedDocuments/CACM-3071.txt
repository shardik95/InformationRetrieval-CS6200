an algorithm using symbolic techniques for thebel-petrov classification of gravitational fieldsin this note an algorithm is presented for thesymbolic calculation of certain algebraic invariants of the weyl tensor which permits the determinationof the bel-petrov types of a gravitational field this algorithm although more specialized than thatof d'inverno and russell-clark requires neither the use of a special coordinate system nor the spin coefficientformalism the algorithm has been implemented in formac and is designed to complete the classificationscheme proposed by petrov in his book an appendix contains examples illustrating the use of the algorithm.cacm september 1978harris r.zund j.general relativity bel-petrov types,formac symbolic manipulation tensors3.11 3.15 3.17ca780901 dh february 5 1979 3:43 pm2170 4 30713071 4 30712165 5 30713071 5 30713071 5 30713071 5 3071
