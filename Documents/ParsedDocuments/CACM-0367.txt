topological ordering of a list ofrandomly-numbered elements of a networka network of directed line segments free of circularelements is assumed the lines are identified by their terminal nodes and the nodes are assumed tobe numbered by a non-topological system given a list of these lines in numeric order a simple techniquecan be used to create at high speed a list in topological order.cacm april 1961lasser d j.ca610401 jb march 17 1978 12:17 am1050 5 3671226 5 367367 5 367367 5 367367 5 367441 5 367758 5 367849 6 367106 6 367209 6 367367 6 367367 6 367367 6 367367 6 367441 6 367627 6 367
