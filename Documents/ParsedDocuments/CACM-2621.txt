a high security log-in procedurethe protection of time sharing systems fromunauthorized users is often achieved by the use of passwords by using one-way ciphers to code the passwords,the risks involved with storing the passwords in the computer can be avoided we discuss the selectionof a suitable one-way cipher and suggest that for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus aresuperior to one-way ciphers derived from sannon codes.cacm august 1974purdy g b.operating systems time sharing systems security cryptography4.35ca740803 jb january 17 1978 10:10 am2621 5 26212621 5 26212621 5 2621
