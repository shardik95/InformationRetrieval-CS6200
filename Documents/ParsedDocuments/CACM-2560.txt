a queuing model of a multiprogrammedcomputer with a two-level storage systemthe results are presented of an analysis ofa probabilistic model of a multiprogrammed computer system with a two-level storage system in which thereis sequential dependency of accesses between the devices expressions are obtained for the long-run probabilitythat both the cpu and each of the storage devices are busy some numerical results are given whichquantify the gains in cpu utilization obtainable by multiprogramming in the presence of this type of storage system.cacm january 1973shedler g s.multiprogrammed computer system storage system hierarchical index sets4.32ca730101 jb january 24 1978 4:55 pm2560 5 25602560 5 25602560 5 2560
