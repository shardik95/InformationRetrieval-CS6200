optimizing binary trees grown with a sorting algorithmitems can be retrieved from binary trees grownwith a form of the algorithm quicksort in an average time proportional to log n where n is the numberof items in the tree the binary trees grown by this algorithm sometimes have some branches longerthan others therefore it is possible to reduce the average retrieval time by restructuring the tree tomake the branches as uniform in length as possible an algorithm to do this is presented the use of thisalgorithm is discussed and it is compared with another which restructures the tree after each new item is added.cacm february 1972martin w a.ness d n.retrieving information from binary trees globaland local optimization sorting recursion3.74 5.31ca720203 jb january 31 1978 4:30 pm1175 4 23881919 4 23881919 4 23881969 4 23881997 4 23882191 4 23882191 4 23882388 4 23882388 4 23882679 4 23882783 4 23882784 4 23883054 4 23883054 4 23883121 4 23883121 4 2388864 4 2388308 5 2388309 5 23882388 5 23882388 5 23882388 5 23882455 5 23882493 5 23882889 5 23882968 5 23882138 6 23882278 6 23882388 6 23882388 6 23882388 6 23882388 6 23882455 6 23882455 6 2388
