an interactive computer graphics approach to surface representationan in teractive computer graphics method has beendeveloped for the rapid generation of arbitrary shaped three-dimensional surfaces the method is a synthesisof spline theory and algorithms an in teractive means for man-machine communication and software forstatic or dynamic graphics display the basic technique employed is a modified lofting method onwhich sectional curves are represented by uniform b-splines and the surface is in terpolated between sectionsby cardinal splines among the features of this method are algorithms which enable in teractivemodification of the b-spline representation of the sectional curves at all stages of the process thespatial information is graphically displayed to the user complex surfaces can be created by the combinationof a number of shapes that have been separately generated and automatically joined the system has beensuccessfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical routines for structural medical and graphical applications.cacm october 1977wu sheng-chuanabel j f.greenberg d p.computer graphics three-dimensional surface representation,splines lofting,finite element input methods3.20 3.23 3.34 8.1 8.2ca771002 jb december 27 1977 11:53 am2924 5 29242924 5 29242924 5 2924
