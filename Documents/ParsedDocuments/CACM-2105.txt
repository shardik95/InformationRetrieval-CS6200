an interactive computer system using graphical flowchart inputan interactive computer system operational on a graphical computer terminal is described this system was designed to demonstrate a method of programming by computer interpretation of a flowchart the user draws a description of asampled-data system and specifies description is transmitted to a largescale computer the design is simulated and a graphic representation of the processed signal is returned to the scope a successful design may require numerous modifications of the original design a graphical interactive system provides an environment to perform this iterative process efficiently and effectively.cacm february 1970robins m f.beyer j d.simulation program graphical input-output sampled data systems3.20 3.24ca700210 jb february 14 1978 9:57 am2003 5 21052105 5 21052105 5 21052105 5 21051710 6 21051767 6 21052105 6 2105
