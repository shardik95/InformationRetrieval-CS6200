an experimental evaluation of data type conventionsthe language in which programs are writtencan have a substantial effect on the reliability of the resulting programs this paper discusses an experimentthat compares the programming reliability of subjects using a statically typed language and a typeless"language analysis of the number of errors and the number of runs containing errors shows that atleast in one environment the use of a statically typed language can increase programming reliability detailed analysis of the errors made by the subjects in programming solutions to reasonably small problemsshows that the subjects had difficulty manipulating the representation of data.cacm august 1977gannon j d.data types experimentation languagedesign redundancy reliable software4.22ca770806jb december 28 1977 7:32 am2411 4 29372709 4 29372889 4 29372937 4 29372989 4 29373005 4 29373025 4 29373101 4 29372138 5 29372937 5 29372937 5 29372937 5 2937
