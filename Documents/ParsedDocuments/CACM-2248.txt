a new method for the solution of thecauchy problem for parabolic equationsan integral equation representation is givenfor parabolic partial differential equations when the equations are defined in unbounded domains asin the initial value cauchy problem the solution of the integral equation by the method of successiveapproximation has inherent advantages over other methods error bounds for the methods are of order h^3/2)and h^7/2 his the increment size depending on the finite difference approximations involved.cacm december 1972moore j.robinson p.parabolic equations the cauchy problem,method of successive approximations5.17ca721207 jb january 27 1978 11:13 am2248 5 22482248 5 22482248 5 2248
