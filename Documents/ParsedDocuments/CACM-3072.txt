feedback coupled resource allocation policiesin the multiprogramming multiprocessor computer systemmodel studies of some integrated feedback-drivenscheduling systems for multiprogrammed multiprocessor computer systems are presented the basic control variablesused are the data-flow rates for the processes executing on the cpu the model systems feature simulatedcontinuous-flow and preempt-resume scheduling of input-output activity attention is given to theamount of memory resource required for effective processing of the i/o activity buffer space assignment the model studies used both distribution-driven and trace-driven techniques even relatively simple dynamicschedulers are shown to improve system performance as measured by user cpu time over that given by optimalor near-optimal static schedulers imbeded in identical system structures and workload environments the improvement is greatest under a heavy i/o demand workload.cacm august 1978brice r.browne j.integrated schedulers feedback scheduling,multiprogramming systems i/o system scheduling4.32 4.35ca780806 dh february 5 1979 4:01 pm2571 4 30722628 4 30722891 4 30722950 4 30723072 4 30723072 4 30723072 4 30723072 4 30723119 4 30721713 5 30722219 5 30722245 5 30722375 5 30723072 5 30723072 5 30723072 5 3072
