tests of probabilistic models for propagation of roundoff errorsin any prolonged computation it is generallyassumed that the accumulated effect of roundoff errors is in some sense statistical the purpose of thispaper is to give precise descriptions of certain probabilistic models for roundoff error and then todescribe a series of experiments for testing the validity of these models it is concluded that the modelsare in general very good discrepancies are both rare and mild the test techniques can also beused to experiment with various types of special arithmetic.cacm february 1966hull t e.swenson j r.ca660210 jb march 3 1978 2:37 pm1474 5 14741474 5 14741474 5 14742525 5 14741474 6 1474
