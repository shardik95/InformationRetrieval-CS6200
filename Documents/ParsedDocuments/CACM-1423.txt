a simple algorithm for computing the generalized inverse of a matrixthe generalized inverse of a matrix is importantin analysis because it provides an extension of the concept of an inverse which applies to all matrices it also has many applications in numerical analysis but it is not widely used because the existingalgorithms are fairly complicated and require considerable storage space a simple extension hasbeen found to the conventional orthogonalization method for inverting non-singular matrices which givesthe generalized inverse with little extra effort and with no additional storage requirements the algorithmgives the generalized inverse for any m by n matrix a including the special case when m+n and ais non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(a  n in the first case the algorithm gives the ordinaryinverse of a in the second case the algorithm yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrixinv(a'a)a and has the advantage of avoiding the loss of significance which results in forming the product a'a explicitly.cacm may 1966rust r.burrus w r.schneeberger c.ca660514 jb march 3 1978 9:22 am1423 5 14231423 5 14231423 5 1423
