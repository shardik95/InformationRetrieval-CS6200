on comput the fast fourier transform coolei and tukei havepropos a fast algorithm for comput complex fourier transform andhave shown major time save in us it to computlarg transform on a digit comput with n a powerof two comput time for thi algorithm is proport ton log2 n a major improv over other method withcomput time proport to n 2 in thi paper thefast fourier transform algorithm is briefli review and fast differequat method for accur comput the need trigonometr function valuar given the problem of comput a larg fourier transformon a system with virtual memori is consid and asolut is propos thi method ha been us to computcomplex fourier transform of size n 2 16 on acomput with 2 15 word of core storag thi exceby a factor of eight the maximum radix two transformsize with fix alloc of thi amount of core storagthe method ha also been us to comput larg mixradix transform a scale plan for comput the fast fouriertransform with fix point arithmet is also given cacm octob1967 singleton r c ca671008 jb februari 27 1978 203 pm 1525 5 1525 1525 5 1525 1525 51525 1668 5 1525 1669 5 1525 1679 5 15251728 5 1525 2859 5 1525 1525 6 1525 15256 1525 1525 6 1525 1525 6 1525 1525 61525 1647 6 1525 1669 6 1525 1676 6 15251785 6 1525
