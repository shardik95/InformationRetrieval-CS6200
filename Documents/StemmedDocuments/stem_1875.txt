polynomi and spline approxim by quadrat program the problem ofapproxim to a given function or of fit a givenset of data where the approxim function is requir tohave certain of it deriv of specifi sign over thewhole rang of approxim is studi two approach ar presentin each of which quadrat program is us to providboth the constraint on the deriv and the select ofthe function which yield the best fit the first isa modifi bernstein polynomi scheme and the second is aspline fit cacm juli 1969 amo d e slater ml constant sign deriv bernstein polynomi linear concav constraint quadratprogram spline 5 13 5 41 ca690705 jb februari 171978 9 22 am 1875 5 1875 1875 5 18751875 5 1875
