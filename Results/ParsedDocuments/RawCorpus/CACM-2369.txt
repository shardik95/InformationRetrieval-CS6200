hidden lines elimination for a rotating objecta method is presented of determining whichparts of three-dimensional objects are visible and which are invisible when the objects are rotated aboutsome axis this paper describes a polygon comparison scheme in which the relationships of two polygons canbe classified into tree types and also discusses how the relationship is changed for each pair of polygonsunder rotation about some axis a rotation table is defined for each pair of polygons which remainsfixed as long as rotation is about one axis and provides a means of rapidly determining the visibleand hidden line relationship between two polygons additional work must be done to extend this approachto simultaneous rotation about several axes.cacm april 1972matsushita y.hidden line problem display programming computergraphics displays graphics computer drawn picture4.40 4.41 4.49ca720404 jb january 31 1978 1:40 pm2369 5 23692369 5 23692369 5 2369
