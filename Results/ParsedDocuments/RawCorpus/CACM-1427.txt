simulation of radioisotope scans by computerin radioisotope scanning a field which is assumingincreasing importance in medical diagnosis the scan is a two-dimensional pattern made up of dots areas of increased source activity are represented on the scan by areas of increased dot density to studythe output of scanners with various characteristics a program which simulates radioisotope scans has beenwritten for a pdp-1 computer with auxiliary disk storage and cathode ray tube display past and presentresearch using the output of the simulator has shown the flexibility of the system to be important the structure of this program can be useful in the simulation of the output of any quantum-limited system.cacm may 1966pizer s m.ca660510 jb march 3 1978 9:47 am1427 5 14271427 5 14271427 5 1427
