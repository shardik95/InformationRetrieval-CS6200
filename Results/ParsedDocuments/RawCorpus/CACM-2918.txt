multiprocessor memory organization and memory interferencethe structure of shared memory in a multiprocessorcomputer system is examined with particular attention to nonin terleaved memory alternative memoryorganizations are compared and it is shown that a home memory organization in which each processoris associated with one or more memories in which its address space is concentrated is quite effective inreducing memory in terference home memory organization is shown to be particularly suited to certain specializedcomputation problems as well as to possess advantages in terms of in terference and reliability forgeneral purpose computation results for in terleaved memory are drawn from previous work and are used forcomparison trace-driven simulations are used to verify the conclusions of the analysis.cacm october 1977smith a j.memory in terference interleaving multiprocessing,trace-driven simulation queueing theory shared memory4.30 4.32 6.34ca771008 jb december 27 1977 10:28 am2918 4 29183119 4 29182859 5 29182918 5 29182918 5 29182918 5 2918
