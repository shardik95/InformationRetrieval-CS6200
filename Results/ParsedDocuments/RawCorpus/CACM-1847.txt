an algorithm for finding a fundamental set of cycles of a grapha fast method is presented for finding a fundamentalset of cycles for an undirected finite graph a spanning tree is grown and the vertices examinedin turn unexamined vertices being stored in a pushdown list to await examination one stagein the process is to take the top element v of the pushdown list and examine it i.e inspect all thoseedges v,z of the graph for which z has not yet been examined if z is already in the tree a fundamentalcycle is added if not the edge v,z is placed in the tree there is exactly one such stagefor each of the n vertices of the graph for large n the store required in creases as n^2 and the time asn^g where g depends on the type of graph involved g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3 and it is shownthat both bounds are attained in terms of storage our algorithm is similar to that of gotlieb andcorneil and superior to that of welch in terms of speed it is similar to that of welch and superiorto that of gotlieb and corneil testsshow our algorithm to be remarkably efficient g=2 on random graphs.cacm september 1969paton k.fundamental cycle set graph algorithm cycle spanning tree5.32ca690909 jb february 15 1978 4:29 pm1847 4 18471961 4 18472052 4 18471504 5 18471847 5 18471847 5 18471847 5 18471961 5 18472177 5 18472763 5 18471369 6 18471504 6 18471847 6 18471847 6 18471847 6 1847
