topological sorting of large networkstopological sorting is a procedure requiredfor many problems involving analysis of networks an example of one such problem is pert the presentpaper presents a very general method for obtaining topological order it permits treatment of larger networksthan can be handled on present procedures and achieves this with greater efficiency althoughthe procedure can be adapted to any machine it is discussed in terms of the 7090 a pert network of30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one hour of machine time the method was developed asa byproduct of procedures needed by westinghouse baltimore it has not been programmed and at presentthere are no plans to implement it in regard to the techniques described westinghouse's presentand anticipated needs are completely served by the lockheed program which is in current use.cacm november 1962kahn a b.ca621120 jb march 17 1978 5:58 pm1050 4 4411226 4 441441 4 441758 4 4411723 5 441367 5 441441 5 441441 5 441441 5 441758 5 441367 6 441441 6 441441 6 441
