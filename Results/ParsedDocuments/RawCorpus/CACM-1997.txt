increasing the efficiency of quicksorta method is presented for the analysis of various generalizations ofquicksort the average asymptotic number of comparisons needed is shown to be an log^2(n a formula is derived expressing a in terms ofthe probability distribution of the bound of a partition this formula assumes a particularly simple form for a generalization alreadyconsidered by hoare namely choice of the bound as medianof a random sample the main contribution of this paper is anothergeneralization of quicksort which uses a bounding interval insteadof a single element as bound this generalization turns out tobe easy to implement in a computer program a numerical approximationshows that a  1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with1.386 for the original this implies a decrease in number of comparisons of 18 percent actual tests showed about 15 percent saving in computing time.cacm september 1970van emden m h.sorting quicksort information content entropy distribution of median3.73 4.49 5.31 5.6ca700908 jb february 10 1978 10:15 am1175 4 19971919 4 19971969 4 19971997 4 19971997 4 19972191 4 19972216 4 19972388 4 19972679 4 19972679 4 19973054 4 19973054 4 19973121 4 19971969 5 19971997 5 19971997 5 19971997 5 1997308 5 19972216 5 19972679 5 19973054 5 1997864 6 1997970 6 19971175 6 19971175 6 19971190 6 19971228 6 19971880 6 19971919 6 19971919 6 19971969 6 19971969 6 19971969 6 19971980 6 19971997 6 19971997 6 19971997 6 1997307 6 1997308 6 1997308 6 1997309 6 19972017 6 19972042 6 19972679 6 19973187 6 1997507 6 1997716 6 1997776 6 1997783 6 1997
