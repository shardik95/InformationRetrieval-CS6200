toward automatic program synthesisan elementary outline of the theorem-provingapproach to automatic program synthesis is given without dwelling on technical details the method isillustrated by the automatic construction of both recursive and iterative programs operating on naturalnumbers,lists and trees in order to construct a program satisfying certain specifications a theoreminduced by those specifications is proved and the desired program is extracted from the proof thesame technique is applied to transform recursively defined functions into iterative programs frequentlywith a major gain inefficiency it is emphasized that in order to construct a program with loops or withrecursion the principle of mathematical induction must be applied the relation between the version ofthe induction rule used and the form of the program constructed is explored in some detail.cacm march 1971manna z.waldinger r j.artificial intelligence answer extraction automaticprogram synthesis mathematical induction principle problem solving theorem proving3.64 5.23 5.24ca710302 jb february 3 1978 4:48 pm1515 4 22102096 4 22102127 4 22102210 4 22101155 5 22102210 5 22102210 5 22102210 5 22102657 5 22102719 5 22101626 6 2210210 6 22102151 6 22102167 6 22102210 6 22102210 6 22102645 6 22102657 6 2210
