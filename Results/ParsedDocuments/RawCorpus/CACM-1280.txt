numerical integration of a differential-differenceequation with a decreasing time-lagsystems in which variable time-lags are presentare of common occurrence in biology variable flow rates are a common cause of these variable lags at present no extensive body of knowledge exists concerning the effects which these variable lags cancause shown here is a method of reducing some differential-difference equations to ordinary differentialequations which can then be studied numerically with ease subsequent study will deal with situationsin which multiple-lags and lags dependent on the solution itself are present.cacm april 1965bellman r e.buell j d.kalaba r e.ca650411 jb march 7 1978 3:46 pm1280 5 12801280 5 12801280 5 12801364 5 12801280 6 1280
