minimizing wasted space in partitioned segmentationa paged virtual memory system using a finitenumber of page sizes is considered two algorithms for assigning pages to segments are discussed bothof these algorithm are simple to implement the problem of choosing the page sizes to minimize the expectedvalue of total wasted space in internal fragmentation and in a page table per segment is then solved for aprobability density function of segment size which may be expressed as a convex combination of erlang densities.cacm june 1973gelenbe e.dynamic storage allocation virtual memory paging,multiple page sizes fragmentation segmentation4.0 4.3 4.32 6.34 8.3ca730602 jb january 23 1978 3:38 pm2095 4 24982218 4 24982498 4 24982596 4 24982734 4 24982902 4 24982911 4 24983000 4 24981879 5 24982498 5 24982498 5 24982498 5 24982911 5 24981879 6 2498273 6 24982435 6 24982498 6 24982734 6 24982773 6 24982983 6 2498
