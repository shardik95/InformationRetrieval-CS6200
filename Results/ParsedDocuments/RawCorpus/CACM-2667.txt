execution characteristics of programs in a page-on-demand systemdata are presented which show the execution characteristicsof two types of commonly used programs in a large-scale time-shared computer system a softwaremonitoring facility built into the supervisor was used for data collection during normal system operation these data were analyzed and results of this analysis are presented for a fortran compilerand an interactive line file editor probability distribution functions and other data are given forsuch things as cpu intervals i/o intervals and the number of such intervals during execution empiricaldistributions are compared with simple theoretical distributions exponential hyperexponential and geometric other data show paging characteristics of tasks as a function of the number of pages those tasks have in core.cacm april 1974boyse j w.program behavior virtual memory paging demand paging,software monitor program execution characteristics compiler execution behavior editor execution behavior4.12 4.19 4.32 4.39 4.9 8.1ca740403 jb january 18 1978 10:12 am1533 4 26671892 4 26671924 4 26671951 4 26672095 4 26672218 4 26672297 4 26672374 4 26672526 4 26672667 4 26672667 4 26672667 4 26672668 4 26672668 4 26672668 4 26672862 4 26672863 4 26671604 5 26671728 5 26671827 5 26672667 5 26672667 5 26672667 5 2667
