estimation of heart parameters using skin potential measurementsa fundamental problem of vector cardiographyis the estimation of the state of the heart on the basis of skin potential measurements a mathematicalmodel relating ventricular dipoles to surface potentials is sketched then it is shown that the inverseproblem-that of determining electrical heart parameters on the basis of skin potential measurements-maybe viewed as a nonlinear multipoint boundary value problem a feasible solution employing quasilinearizationand high-speed digital computers is given.cacm november 1964bellman r.collier c.kagiwada h.kalaba r.selvester r.ca641110 jb march 9 1978 4:00 pm973 5 973973 5 973973 5 9731278 5 973973 6 9731028 6 9731029 6 973
