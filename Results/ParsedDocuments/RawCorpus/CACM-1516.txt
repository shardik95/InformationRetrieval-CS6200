automatic data compressionthe information explosion noted in recentyears makes it essential that storage requirements for all information be kept to a minimum a fully automaticand rapid three-part compressor which can be used with any body of information to greatly reduceslow external storage requirements and to increase the rate of information transmission through a computeris described in this paper the system will also automatically decode the compressed informationon an item-by-item basis when it is required the three component compressors which can be used separatelyto accomplish their specific tasks are discussed nupak for the automatic compression of numerical data anpakfor the automatic compression of any information and iopak for further compression of information to be stored on tape or cards.cacm november 1967marron b a.demaine p a d.ca671104 jb february 26 1978 3:08 pm1516 5 15161516 5 15161516 5 1516
