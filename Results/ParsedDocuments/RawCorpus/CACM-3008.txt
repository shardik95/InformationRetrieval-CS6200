preserving average proximity in arraysprogrammers and data structure designers are oftenforced to choose between alternative structures in storing these structures preserving logical adjacenciesor proximity is usually an important consideration the combinatorial problem of storing arrays as variouskinds of list structures is examined embeddings of graphs are used to model the loss of proximity involvedin such storage schemes and an elementary proof that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists withbounded loss of proximity is presented average loss of proximity is then considered and it is shownthat arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with only bounded loss of average proximity but can be sostored in binary trees the former result implies for instance that row major order is an asymptoticallyoptimal storage strategy for arrays.cacm march 1978demillo r.eisenstat s.lipton r.arrays graph embedding linear lists,proximity average proximity trees4.34 5.24 5.25 5.32ca780305 jb march 28 1978 1:07 pm1050 4 30081102 4 3008378 4 30083008 4 3008731 4 3008798 4 3008209 5 30083008 5 30083008 5 30083008 5 3008
