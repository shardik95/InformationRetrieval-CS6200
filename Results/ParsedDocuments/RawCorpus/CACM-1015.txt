near-minimax polynomial approximations and partitioning of intervalsa method of near-minimax polynomial approximationis described as a by-product this method provides a formula for an estimate of the maximum errorassociated with a given degree of approximation using this formula a partitioning algorithm is obtainedfor dividing a basic interval into subintervals for which approximations of equal degree give equal maximum error.cacm august 1964fraser w.hart j f.ca640815 jb march 9 1978 6:41 pm1015 4 10151346 4 10151440 4 10151645 4 1015951 4 10151015 5 10151015 5 10151015 5 1015532 5 1015
