optimal his togram matching by monotone gray level transformationthis paper investigates the problem of optimalhis togram matching using monotone gray level transformation which always assigns all picture pointsof a given gray level i to another gray level t(i such that if i  j then t(i  t(j the objectiveis to find a transformed digital picture of a given picture such that the sum of absolute errorsbetween the gray level his togram of the transformed picture and that of a reference picture is minimized this is equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered objects of different sized one by one into k2 linearly orderedboxes of assorted sizes such that the accumulated error of space under packed or overpackedin the boxes is minimized the placement function is monotonic which ensures a polynomial time solutionto this problem a tree search algorithm for optimal his togram matching is presented which has timecomplexity o(k1 x k2 if the monotone property is dropped then the problem becomes np-complete,even if it is restricted to k2  2 cacm october 1978chang s.wong y.optimal his togram matching gray level transformation,packing problem tree searching algorithm picture processing3.24 5.25 5.42ca781004 dh january 29 1979 6:08 pm3057 5 30573057 5 30573057 5 3057
