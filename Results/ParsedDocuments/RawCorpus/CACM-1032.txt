theoretical considerations in information retrieval systemsinformation storage and retrieval systems are composedof three major components a identification of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,b searching strategy how to enter the file to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material and(c file organization to make access to information efficient for identification of information the papersuggests that a metalanguage recently discussed in a paper by goffman verhoeff and belzer associatedwith an object language be used for searching strategy a linear model for an evaluation functionof relevancy is developed which rewards the system for retrieving relevant documents and not retrievingthe nonrelevant and penalizes the system for the escaped relevant documents and false drops the inadequaciesof a linear model are indicated two approaches to file organization are discussed one is self-organizationof the file based on its history and past performance and the second is a self-generating subsetof the file with a high probability of being relevant.cacm july 1964belzer j.goffman w.ca640715 jb march 9 1978 7:55 pm1032 5 10321032 5 10321032 5 1032
