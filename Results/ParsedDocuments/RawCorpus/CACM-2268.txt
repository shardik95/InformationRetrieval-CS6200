a comparative study of computer programsfor integrating differential equationsa study comparing the performance of several computerprograms for integrating systems of ordinary differential equations is reported the integration methods representedinclude multistep methods predictor-correctors single-step methods runge-kutta and extrapolation methods(both polynomial and rational the testing procedure is described together with the evaluationcriteria applied a set of test problems on which the programs were tested is included in an appendix for the particular problems and criteria used in the investigation it was found that a program based onrational extrapolation showed the best performance.cacm november 1972fox p.ordinary differential equations integration,program comparison certification validation5.10 5.17ca721101 jb january 27 1978 2:45 pm2268 5 22682268 5 22682268 5 22682567 5 22682268 6 2268755 6 2268
