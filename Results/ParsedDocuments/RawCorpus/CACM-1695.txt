plexus-an on-line system for modeling neural networksa description is presented of plexus a systemwhich enables a user to construct and specify a neural network to analyze the output data producedby the network and to store and retrieve networks and data from a library the system operated entirelyfrom a digital display unit interacts directly with the user and permits easy and rapid transitionsbetween the various phases of the modeling process plexus is designed to complement neurophysiological researchso that the systematic development of neural models can be coordinated with experimental work plexusnetworks are built up from components representing individual neurons external stimuli and interconnectingfibers each component being of a relatively detailed nature provision is also made for the use ofexperimental data as input to a network convenient means for specification and modification of a network andextensive error-checking capabilities are provided data resulting from the simulation of a network may beanalyzed by a variety of techniques ranging from examinations of the gross characteristics of the data tothe determination of detailed statistical properties.cacm september 1968dill j c.randall d l.richer i.biological modeling data analysis discrete systemsimulation library systems modeling network simulation neural networks neurophysiologicalmodels on-line simulation simulation3.12 3.19 3.29 3.65ca680906 jb february 22 1978 8:56 am1695 5 16951695 5 16951695 5 1695
