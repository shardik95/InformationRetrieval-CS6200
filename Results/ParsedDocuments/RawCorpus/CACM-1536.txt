dynamic computation of derivativesit is shown how wengert's procedure for computationof derivatives can be implemented conveniently by use of compiler-generated complex addition subtraction,and linkage to complex arithmetic subroutines evaluation of a function and derivative proceed inparallel as in wengert's procedure but with the imaginary parts of variables declared complex bearingthe values of the derivatives of the real parts this technique provides a simple way to compute thederivatives of a function without the need for deriving and programming the evaluation ofexplicit formulas for the derivatives.cacm september 1967lesk a m.ca670908 jb february 27 1978 3:11 pm1028 4 15361216 4 15361278 4 15361347 4 15361396 4 15361536 4 15361029 5 15361536 5 15361536 5 15361536 5 1536
