reentrant polygon clippinga new family of clipping algorithms is described these algorithms are able to clip polygons against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in threedimensions removing the parts of the polygon which lie outside the volume in two dimensions the algorithmspermit clipping against irregular convex windows polygons to be clipped are represented as an orderedsequence of vertices without repetition of first and last in marked contrast to representation as acollection of edges as was heretofore the common procedure output polygons have an identical format,with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe any newly-cut edge or edges the algorithms easily handlethe particularly difficult problem of detecting that a new vertex may be required at a corner of theclipping window the algorithms described achieve considerable simplicity by clipping separately againsteach clipping plane or window boundary code capable of clipping the polygon against a single boundaryis reentered to clip against subsequent boundaries each such reentrant stage of clipping need store onlytwo vertex values and may begin its processing as soon as the first output vertex from the proceedingstage is ready because the same code is reentered for clipping against subsequent boundaries clippingagainst very complex window shapes is practical for perspective applications in three dimentions a six-planetruncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping volume the two additional planes parallel to the projectionscreen serve to limit the range of depth preserved through the projection a perspective projectionmethod which provides for arbitrary view angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clippingplanes is described this method is ideal for subsequent hidden-surface computations.cacm january 1974sutherland i e.hodgman g w.computer graphics hidden-surface clipping5.31 6.32 6.35ca740107 jb january 18 1978 2:04 pm2004 4 26922687 4 26922692 4 26921915 5 26922692 5 26922692 5 26922692 5 2692
