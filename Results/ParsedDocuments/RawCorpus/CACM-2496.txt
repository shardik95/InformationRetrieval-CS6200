on the near-optimality of the shortest-latency-time-firstdrum scheduling disciplinefor computer systems in which it is practicalto determine the instantaneous drum position a popular discipline for determining the sequence in whichthe records are to be accessed is the so-called shortest-latency-time-first sltf discipline whena collection of varying-length records is to be accessed from specified drum positions it is known thatthe sltf discipline does not necessarily minimize the drum latency time however we show that the totaltime to access the entire collection for any sltf schedule is never as much as a drum revolutionlonger than a minimum latency schedule.cacm june 1973stone h s.fuller s h.drum scheduling shortest-access-time-first minimallatency scheduling shortest-latency-time-first4.31 4.41 6.35ca730604 jb january 23 1978 3:12 pm2496 5 24962496 5 24962496 5 24962628 5 24963097 5 24962375 6 24962496 6 24962496 6 2496
