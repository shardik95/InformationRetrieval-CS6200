blocks-a new data type for snobol4a new data type called a block has been implementedfor snobol4 a block is a three-dimensional aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped,best thought of as a three-dimensional extension to a string the third dimension is used foroverstriking blocks may be printed concatenated in any of three dimensions and merged on the basisof program-defined connection points some blocks adapt in size and shape to their environment blocksand their operations are mainly used for composing printable output a variety of graphical problems includingflowcharting bargraphs logic diagrams mathematical-equation formation and text justificationand preparation have been programmed on a printer in what appears to be an easy and natural way in additionto these somewhat specialized applications blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independentoutput formation mechanism especially suitable for nonnumerical work the concept of a block is largelylanguage independenthat is blocks require little in the way of specialized syntax and could readilybe absorbed into the external structure of most programming languages.cacm june 1972gimpel j f.character manipulation output formatting stringprocessing graphics nonnumerical programming snobol4 data types two-dimensional mathematics test processing flowcharting4.22 4.41ca720604 jb january 30 1978 4:38 pm1086 4 23411132 4 23411234 4 23411263 4 23411265 4 23411270 4 23411323 4 23411358 4 23411379 4 23411380 4 23411453 4 23411464 4 23411484 4 23411491 4 23411498 4 23411613 4 23411614 4 23411767 4 23411781 4 23411781 4 23411781 4 23411825 4 23411860 4 23411945 4 23412083 4 23412178 4 23412179 4 23412252 4 23412325 4 23412341 4 23412341 4 23412341 4 23412341 4 23412546 4 23412645 4 23412652 4 23412684 4 23412842 4 23412929 4 23412934 4 23413069 4 2341669 4 2341679 4 2341691 4 2341761 4 2341949 4 2341989 4 2341990 5 23411466 5 23411468 5 23412341 5 23412341 5 23412341 5 23412545 5 23413184 5 23411739 6 23411781 6 23412341 6 2341
