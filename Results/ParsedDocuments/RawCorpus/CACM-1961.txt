an efficient search algorithm to find the elementary circuits of a grapha theoretically most efficient search algorithm is presentedwhich uses an exhaustive search to find all of the elementarycircuits of a graph the algorithm can be easily modified to find allof the elementary circuits with a particular attribute such aslength a rigorous proof of the algorithm is given as well as an exampleof its application empirical bounds are presented relatingthe speed of the algorithm to the number of vertices and the numberof arcs the speed is also related to the number of circuitsin the graph to give a relation between speed and complexity.extensions to undirected and s-graphs are discussed.cacm december 1970tiernan j c.algorithm graph theory circuit searchalgorithm path search algorithm searching3.74 5.32ca701202 jb february 9 1978 4:12 pm1847 4 19611961 4 19611961 4 19611961 4 19612052 4 19612177 4 19612763 4 19611369 5 19611504 5 19611847 5 19611961 5 19611961 5 19611961 5 19612430 5 19611961 6 1961
