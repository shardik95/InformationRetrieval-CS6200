median split trees a fast lookup technique for frequently occuring keyssplit trees are a new technique for searching setsof keys with highly skewed frequency distributions a split tree is a binary search tree each node of whichcontains two key values-a node value which is a maximally frequent key in that subtree and a splitvalue which partitions the remaining keys with respect to their lexical ordering between the left andright subtrees a median split tree mst uses the lexical median of a node's descendents as its splitvalue to force the search tree to be perfectly balanced achieving both a space efficient representationof the tree and high search speed unlike frequency ordered binary search trees the cost of asuccessful search of an mst is log n bounded and very stable around minimal values further an mstcan be built for a given key ordering and set of frequencies in time n log n as opposed to n2 for anoptimum binary search tree a discussion of the application of mst's to dictionary lookup for english ispresented and the performance obtained is contrasted with that of other techniques.cacm november 1978sheil b.tree search dictionary lookup binary search heaps,balanced trees zipf's law information retrieval3.74 5.25 5.39ca781110 dh january 25 1979 9:49 am3041 4 30413041 4 30413126 4 30413176 4 30412846 5 30412905 5 30413041 5 30413041 5 30413041 5 3041
