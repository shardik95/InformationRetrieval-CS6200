a graph formulation of a school scheduling algorithmthe problem classically titled the examinationschedule problem takes various forms in the literature most of these formulations can be presentedin the terminology of classical network theory one such formulation is given a nondirected network,partition its nodes into a minimal number of subsets such that no two members of the same subsetare connected by anarc an obvious lower limit to this number is the size of the largest strongly connectedsubgraph kirchgassner proved that an upper limit is this size plus one one logical extension ofthe previous work is the introduction of variable length examinations where w(i is the number of periodsfor exam i the object of this paper is to generalize the definition of largest strongly connected subgraphto include the weighting of nodes to present an approximate algorithm which usually finds the largeststrongly connected subgraph and to discuss the application of this algorithm to the solution ofschool scheduling and exam scheduling problems.cacm december 1974salazar a.oakford r v.scheduling school scheduling examination scheduling,nondirected network graph subgraph strongly connected subgraph3.51 3.52ca741206 jb january 13 1978 4:37 pm2568 5 25682568 5 25682568 5 2568
