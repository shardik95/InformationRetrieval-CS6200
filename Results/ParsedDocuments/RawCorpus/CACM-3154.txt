algorithm  logic  controlan algorithm can be regarded as consisting of a logic component,which specifies the knowledge to be used in solving problems,and a control component which determines the problem-solvingstrategies by means of which that knowledge is used the logic componentdetermines the meaning of the algorithm whereas the controlcomponent only affects its efficiency the efficiency of analgorithm can often by improving the control component without changingthe logic of the algorithm we argue that computer programs wouldbe more often correct and more easily improved and modified iftheir logic and control aspects were identified and separated inthe program text cacm july 1979kowalski r.control language logic programming nonprocedural language programmingmethodology program specification relational data structures 3.64 4.20 4.30 5.21 5.24ca790705 dh september 24 1979 5:08 pm1989 4 31542060 4 31542155 4 31542179 4 31542406 4 31542698 4 31542710 4 31542715 4 31542716 4 31542717 4 31542718 4 31542765 4 31542817 4 31542888 4 31542901 4 31542921 4 31542957 4 31542959 4 31542965 4 31543087 4 31543154 4 31543154 4 31543154 4 31542046 5 31542110 5 31543133 5 31543154 5 31543154 5 31543154 5 31543154 6 3154
