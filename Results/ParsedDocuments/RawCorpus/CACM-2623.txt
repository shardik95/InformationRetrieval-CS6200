a new technique for compression and storage of datathe widespread tendency toward storage oflarge programs and blocks off text has produced a need for efficient methods of compressing and storingdata this paper describes techniques that can in most cases decrease storage size by a factor offrom two to four the techniques involve special handling of leading and trailing blanks and the encodingof other symbols in groups of fixed size as unique fixed point numbers the efficiency of thesystem is considered and pertinent statistics are given and compared with statistics for other information coding techniques.cacm august 1974hahn b.file maintenance information retrieval utilityprograms text compression coding techniques data storage data management3.70 3.73 4.49ca740801 jb january 17 1978 10:25 am2530 4 26232623 4 26232623 4 26232819 4 26232501 5 26232537 5 26232623 5 26232623 5 26232623 5 2623
