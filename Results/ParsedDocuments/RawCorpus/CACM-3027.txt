the development of the mu5 computer systemfollowing a brief outline of the backgroundof the mu5 project the aims and ideas for mu5 are discussed a description is then given of the instructionset which includes a number of features conducive to the production of efficient compiled codefrom high-level language source programs the design of the processor is then traced from the initialideas for an associatively addressed name store to the final multistage pipeline structure involvinga prediction mechanism for instruction prefetching and a function queue for array element accessing anoverall view of the complete mu5 complex is presented together with a brief indication of its performance.cacm january 1978ibbett r.capon p.architecture naming virtual storage instructionset descriptor pipeline instruction buffering associative storage function queue computer complex4.10 4.12 6.21 6.33ca780103 jb march 28 1978 5:44 pm3027 4 30273027 5 30273027 5 30273027 5 30273028 5 30273027 6 3027
