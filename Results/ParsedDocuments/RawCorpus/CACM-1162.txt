an assembly language for reprogrammingcomplete reprogramming of compiler language programsis seldom necessary it is assembly language programs which present the greatest difficulty assemblylanguages generally provide a one-for-one translation from a symbolic to a numeric version of a program thatis from assembly language to machine language the meta-language presented here can be used to specifythe mapping of any language which conforms to a canonical list form into an arbitrary stream of bits this bit stream may be treated as a machine language program a character stream or whatever elsethe user might desire thus this meta-language can be used to map from one assembly language into anotheror from the assembly language for one machine into the machine language of another.cacm december 1965graham m l.ingerman p z.ca651207 jb march 6 1978 4:01 pm1162 5 11621162 5 11621162 5 11621565 5 11621162 6 11621358 6 11621455 6 1162205 6 1162
