a program to solve the pentomino problem by the recursive use of macrosa coding technique is described in which certainmacro-instructions are given lists as arguments and are thereby used recursively the discussion coversprimarily an example in which the technique is used to solve the pentomino problem-the problem offitting 12 pentominos without overlapping into a plane area formed of 60 elemental squares.cacm october 1965fletcher j g.ca651010 jb march 6 1978 6:37 pm1185 5 11851185 5 11851185 5 11851531 5 11852707 5 11852753 5 11851185 6 11851185 6 11851185 6 11851455 6 1185
