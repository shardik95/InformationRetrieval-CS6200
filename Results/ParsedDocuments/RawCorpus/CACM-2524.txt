some approaches to best-match file searchingthe problem of searching the set of keys ina file to find a key which is closest to a given query key is discussed after closest in terms ofa metric on the the key space is suitably defined three file structures are presented together with theircorresponding search algorithms which are intended to reduce the number of comparisons required to achievethe desired result these methods are derived using certain inequalities satisfied by metrics and bygraph-theoretic concepts some empirical results are presented which compare the efficiency of the methods.cacm april 1973burkhard w a.keller r m.matching file structuring file searching heuristics best match3.73 3.79 4.9ca730404 jb january 24 1978 9:54 am1676 4 25241682 4 25241728 4 25241860 4 25241973 4 25242018 4 25242032 4 25242033 4 25242107 4 25242109 4 25242203 4 25242251 4 25242359 4 25242524 4 25242543 4 25242552 4 25242559 4 25242991 4 25243053 4 25241785 5 25242524 5 25242524 5 25242524 5 25242575 5 25242966 5 25243134 5 25241976 6 25242160 6 25242524 6 25242524 6 25242524 6 25242990 6 2524
