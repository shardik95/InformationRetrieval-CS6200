computer generation of gamma random variables  iia rejection method is proposed for generatinggamma variates with nonintegral shape parameter a a  1 this method is similar to other methods givenby fishman wallace and tadikamalla and is faster than these methods for a 2 the core storage requirementsand the programming effort for the proposed method are similar to those of wallace's or tadikamalla'smethods the computational times for the proposed method remain fairly constant for medium and largevalues of a and are superior to times obtained by ahrens and dieter's method for all values of a theproposed method is simpler than ahrens and dieter's method.cacm november 1978tadikamalla p.gamma variables rejection method computer methods5.5 8.1ca781105 dh january 26 1979 11:02 am2847 4 30462928 4 30463046 4 30463046 4 30463046 4 30463098 4 30463098 4 30463107 4 30462569 5 30462847 5 30463046 5 30463046 5 30463046 5 30463098 5 3046
