an encoding method for multifield sorting and indexingsequences of character strings with an orderrelation imposed between sequences are considered an encoding scheme is described which produces a single,order-preserving string from a sequence of strings the original sequence can be recovered fromthe encoded string and one sequence of strings precedes another if and only if the encoding of the firstprecedes the encoding of the second the strings may be variable length without a maximum length restriction,and no symbols need be reserved for control purposes hence any symbol may occur in any string thescheme is useful for multifield sorting multifield indexing and other applications where orderingon more than one field is important.cacm november 1977blasgen m w.casey r g.eswaran k p.sorting multifield indexes lexicographic order searching encoding3.74 4.19 4.33 4.40 5.31ca771115 jb december 27 1977 5:55 am2140 4 29012155 4 29012406 4 29012452 4 29012710 4 29012710 4 29012715 4 29012716 4 29012716 4 29012717 4 29012718 4 29012765 4 29012765 4 29012817 4 29012888 4 29012901 4 29012901 4 29012901 4 29012957 4 29012959 4 29012965 4 29013087 4 29013134 4 29013154 4 29011976 5 29012046 5 29012715 5 29012901 5 29012901 5 29012901 5 2901
