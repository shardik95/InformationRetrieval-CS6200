the augmented predictive analyzer for context-freelanguages-its relative efficiencyit has been proven by greibach that for a givencontext-free grammar g a standard-form grammar gs can be constructed which generates the same languagesas is generated by g and whose rules are all of the form z  cy(1  y(m m  o where z andy(i are intermediate symbols and c a terminal symbol since the predictive analyzer at harvard usesa standard-form grammar it can accept the language of any context-free grammar g given an equivalent standard-formgrammar gs the structural descriptions sd(gs,x assigned to a given sentence x by the predictiveanalyzer however are usually different from the structural descriptions sd(g,x assigned to thesame sentence by the original context-free grammar g from which gs is derived in section 1 an algorithm,originally due to abbott is described standard-form grammar each of whose rules is in standard form supplementedby additional information describing its derivation from the original context-free grammar a technique for performing the sd(gs,x to sd(g,x transformation effectively is also described in section2 the augmented predictive analyzer as a parsing algorithm for arbitrary context-free languages is comparedwith two other parsing algorithms a selective top-to-bottom algorithm similar to irons error correctingparse algorithm and an immediate constituent analyzer which is an extension of sakai-cocke's algorithmfor normal grammars the comparison is based upon several criteria of efficiency covering core-storagerequirements complexities of the programs and processing time.cacm november 1966kuno,s.ca661108 jb march 2 1978 3:11 pm1225 4 13501225 4 13501350 4 13501350 4 13501350 4 13501350 4 13501350 4 13501399 4 13501646 4 13501659 4 13501659 4 13501768 4 13501781 4 13501781 4 13501856 4 13501945 4 13501945 4 13501945 4 13502050 4 13502110 4 13502650 4 13502698 4 13502708 4 13503093 4 13503094 4 13501012 5 13501225 5 13501265 5 13501350 5 13501350 5 13501350 5 13501399 5 13501659 5 1350680 5 13501225 6 13501265 6 13501350 6 13501671 6 13501697 6 1350
