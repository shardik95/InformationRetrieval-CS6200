a highly parallel algorithm for approximatingall zeros of a polynomial with only real zerosan algorithm is described based on newton'smethod which simultaneously approximates all zeros of a polynomial with only real zeros the algorithm whichis conceptually suitable for parallel computation determines its own starting values so that convergenceto the zeros is guaranteed multiple zeros and their multiplicity are readily determined at nopoint in the method is polynomial deflation used.cacm november 1972patrick m l.parallel numerical algorithms real polynomials,real zeros newton's method starting values guaranteed convergence5.15ca721103 jb january 27 1978 2:35 pm2266 5 22662266 5 22662266 5 22662660 5 22662266 6 2266
