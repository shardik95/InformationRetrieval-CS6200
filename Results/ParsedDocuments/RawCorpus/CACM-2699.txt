automatic data structure choice in a language of very high levelsetl is a set-theoretically oriented languageof very high level whose repertoire of semantic objects includes finite sets ordered n-tuples andsets of ordered n-tuples usable as mappings this paper describes the structure of an optimizer for thislanguage among other methods of interest the optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusionand membership to be established the domains and ranges of tabulated mappings to be estimated fromabove and below and the single-valuedness of tabulated mappings to be proved once facts of thiskind have been established automatic choice of data structures becomes possible the methods employedare based upon and extend known techniques of data flow analysis.cacm december 1975schwartz j t.program optimization automatic programming high-levellanguages set-theoretic languages data structure choice4.12 4.20 4.22ca751208 jb january 5 1978 3:53 pm2699 5 26992699 5 26992699 5 2699
