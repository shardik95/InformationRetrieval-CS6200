synchronizing processors with memory-content-generated interruptsimplementations of the lock-unlock methodof synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor system usually require uninterruptable memory-pause type instructions an interlock scheme called read-interlock which does not require memory-pause instructions hasbeen developed for a dual dec pdp-10 system with real-time requirements the read-interlock method doesrequire a special"read-interlock instruction in the repertoire of the processors and a special read-interlock"cycle in the repertoire of the memory modules when a processor examines a lock a memorylocation with a read-interlock instruction it will be interrupted if the lock was already set examininga lock immediately sets it if it was not already set this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle writing into a lock clears it having the processor interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead ofbranching is advantageous if the branch would have resulted in an effective interrupt.cacm june 1973hill j c.interrupts,supervisors monitors debugging parallelprocessing associative memories microprogramming4.32 6.29ca730603 jb january 23 1978 3:29 pm1458 4 24971523 4 24971603 4 24971698 4 24971747 4 24971748 4 24971854 4 24971877 4 24971960 4 24972377 4 24972378 4 24972497 4 24972497 4 24972534 4 24972558 4 24972625 4 24972632 4 24972840 4 24972941 4 24973105 4 24973144 4 24971471 5 24972182 5 24972497 5 24972497 5 24972497 5 2497
