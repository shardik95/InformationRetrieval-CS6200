design and characteristics of a variable-lengthrecord sort using new fixed-length record sorting techniquesthis paper describes the application of severalnew techniques for sorting fixed-length records to the problems of variable-length record sorting the techniques have been implemented on a sylvania 9400 computer system with 32,000 fixed-length wordsof memory specifically the techniques sequence variable-length records of unrestricted size producelong initial strings of data merge strings of data at the power of t-1 where t is the number of worktapes in a system and do not restrict the volume of input data.cacm may,1963goetz m a.ca630516 jb march 14 1978 10:57 am2017 4 8512017 4 851851 4 851851 4 8512017 5 851851 5 851851 5 851851 5 851858 5 851865 5 851849 6 851850 6 851851 6 851852 6 851853 6 851854 6 851855 6 851856 6 851857 6 851858 6 851859 6 851860 6 851861 6 851862 6 851863 6 851864 6 851865 6 851866 6 851
