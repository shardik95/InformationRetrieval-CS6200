the control of response times in multi-classsystems by memory allocations the possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of differentclasses by regulating their memory allocation is examined inthe context of a paged computer system two parameterized algorithmswhich partition the main memory between two classes of jobs areconsidered initially a closed system consisting of a processor and paging and file devices with fixed numbers of jobs is studiedto determine optimal degrees of multiprogramming and the proportionof processor time devoted to each class applying a decompositionapproach and treating the closed system as a single server,the response times in an open system with external arrivals arestudied the object is to investigate the effect of the memoryalocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms.numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for theexpected response times as functions of the control parametersare obtained a way of applying the results to systems with morethan two job classes is indicated.cacm july 1979hine j.mitrani i.tsur s.queueing networks paging virtual memory performance control4.32 8.1ca790704 dh august 22 1979 3:32 pm3016 4 31533070 4 31533153 4 31533153 4 31532741 5 31532891 5 31533153 5 31533153 5 31533153 5 3153
