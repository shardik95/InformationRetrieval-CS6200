automation of etching-pattern layouthelp heuristic etching-pattern layout program)is an application program developed to computerize the tedious and error-prone although vitally importantwiring design of printed circuit boards help helps automate a design stage one step closer to productionthan logical design it can be used to design wiring patterns of two-layer circuit boards on whichics in dual-in-line packages as well as discrete components such as transistors and resistors have beenplaced help employs two methods of wiring one is the heuristic method which simulates humanapproaches to wiring design and the other is the theoretically interesting but time-consuming method ofmaze-running based on the lee's algorithm help performs more than 90 percent of required wiring bythe heuristic path with respect to a performance function for each point-to-point and point-to-lineconnection it can bring the number of successful wiring connections very close to 100 percent.cacm november 1971aramaki i.kawabata t.kazuhiko a.heuristic etching-pattern layout wiring design ofprinted circuit board maze-running lee's algorithm3.24 3.66 4.9 6.9ca711104 jb february 2 1978 10:58 am2145 5 21452145 5 21452145 5 2145
