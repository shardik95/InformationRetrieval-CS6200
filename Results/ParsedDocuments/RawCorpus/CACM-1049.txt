numerical solution of nonlinear two-pointboundary problems by finite difference methodssolution of nonlinear two-point boundary-valueproblems is often an extremely difficult task quite apart from questions of reality and uniqueness,there is no established numerical technique for this problem at present shooting techniques are theeasiest method of attacking these problems when these fail the more difficult method of finite differencescan often be used to obtain a solution this paper gives examples and discusses the finite differencemethod for non-linear two-point boundary-value problems.cacm june 1964holt j f.ca640618 jb march 9 1978 9:07 pm1049 4 10491049 5 10491049 5 10491049 5 1049416 5 1049
