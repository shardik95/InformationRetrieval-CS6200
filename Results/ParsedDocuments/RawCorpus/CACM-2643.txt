the minimization of spatially-multiplexed character setsthe paper describes a technique for compactingcharacter sets in a digital computer while retaining fast access to individual bits it considers the problemof minimizing the storage needed to contain such tables reduction techniques are developed andthe problem is shown to reduce to a covering problem.cacm june 1974gimpel j f.parsing lexical analysis,scanning,string processing spatial multiplexing4.9ca740603 jb january 17 1978 3:31 pm2643 5 26432643 5 26432643 5 26432706 5 26432643 6 2643
