order-n correction for regular languagesa method is presented for calculating a stringb belonging to a given regular language l which is nearest in number of edit operations to agiven input string a b is viewed as a reasonable correction for the possibly erroneous string a wherea was originally intended to be a string of l the calculation of b by the method presented requirestime proportional to a the number of characters in a the method should find applications in informationretrieval artificial intelligence and spelling correction systems.cacm may 1974wagner r a.error correction regular languages regular events,finite state automata compiler error recovery spelling correction string best match problem correction,corrector errors nondeterministic finite-state automata4.12 4.20 5.22 5.23 5.42ca740503 jb january 17 1978 4:26 pm1179 4 26501225 4 26501288 4 26501350 4 26501544 4 26501646 4 26501646 4 26501781 4 26501846 4 26501945 4 26502111 4 26502534 4 26502534 4 26502556 4 26502556 4 26502630 4 26502650 4 26502650 4 26502650 4 26502650 4 26502698 4 26502708 4 26502708 4 26502887 4 26503093 4 26502111 5 26502650 5 26502650 5 26502650 5 2650576 5 2650680 5 2650830 5 2650
