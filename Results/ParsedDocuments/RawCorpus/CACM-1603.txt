a multiprogramming monitor for small machinesint a combination hardware/software monitordesigned to control a wide variety of real-time input/output devices is described the simple hardwareadditions provide a uniform device to machine interface for such elements as keyboards graphic inputdevices and interval timers the software relieves the user program from the details of input/output timing,buffering and task scheduling and provides parallel processing capability user programs communicatewith the monitor through a small set of meta-instruction which consists mostly of machine-language subroutine calls.cacm may 1967hornbuckle g d.ca670503 jb february 28 1978 10:57 am1458 4 16031523 4 16031603 4 16031698 4 16031747 4 16031748 4 16031854 4 16031877 4 16031960 4 16032377 4 16032378 4 16032497 4 16032558 4 16032625 4 16032632 4 16032840 4 16032941 4 16033105 4 16033144 4 16031471 5 16031603 5 16031603 5 16031603 5 1603
