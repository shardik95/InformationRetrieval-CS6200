computer formulation of the equations of motion using tensor notationa means is described for extending the areaof application of digital computers beyond the numerical data processing stage and reducing the need forhuman participation in the formulation of certain types of computer problems by the use of tensor calculusand a computer language designed to facilitate symbolic mathematical computation a method has beendevised whereby a digital computer can be used to do non-numeric work that is symbolic algebraic manipulationand differentiation to illustrate the techniques involved a digital computer has been usedto derive the equations of motion of a point mass in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system since this operation involves a formulation in terms of first and second-order differential coefficients,it provides a good demonstration of a computer's capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in theformulation process which normally precedes the numerical data processing stage moreover this particularproblem serves to illustrate the advantages of the mathematical techniques employed with the programprepared for this purpose the computer will derive the equations of motion in any coordinate systemrequested by the user results are presented for the following coordinate systems cylindricalpolar spherical polar and prolate spheroidal.cacm september 1967howard j c.ca670903 jb february 27 1978 3:58 pm1543 4 15431543 4 15431664 4 15431664 4 15431345 5 15431543 5 15431543 5 15431543 5 15431616 5 15431664 5 15431345 6 15431543 6 15431616 6 1543
