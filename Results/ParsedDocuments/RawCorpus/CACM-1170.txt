analyzing english syntax with a pattern-learning parsera dependency analysis system based on patternrecognition and learning logic was developed to infer word classes and rules of syntactic combinationfrom experience with text which had been analyzed the characteristics used to form word classes are thedepth in the dependency tree of each word the direction of its governor and the same features foreach of its immediate neighbors syntactic rules of combination show the relation of a word to its governorin the depth pattern of the sentence the system was tested on 400 elementary basic english sentencesincluding 300 used earlier by knowlton in a different learning parser of all 400 sentences afterexperience with 300 sentences it was able to generalize with 77 percent accuracy to the next 100 in accumulative learning trials after the first 200 sentences it averaged a probability of 9 for accuratelyparsing each new sentence it encountered it was concluded that the system is adequate for learningto parse the bulk of basic english but that further development is required before conclusions aboutits application to ordinary english can be stored the system is operational and available onthe arpa/sdc time-shared computing system.cacm november 1965mcconlogue k.simmons r f.ca651111 jb march 6 1978 4:45 pm1170 5 11701170 5 11701170 5 1170
