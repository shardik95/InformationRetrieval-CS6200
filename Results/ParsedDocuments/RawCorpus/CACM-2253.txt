index ranges for matrix calculithe paper describes a scheme for symbolicmanipulation of index expressions which arise as a by-product of the symbolic manipulation of expressionsin the matrix calculi described by the authors in a previous paper this scheme attempts program optimizationby transforming the original algorithm rather than the machine code the goal is to automaticallygenerate code for handling the tedious address calculations necessitated by complicated data structures the paper is therefore preoccupied with indexing by position the relationship of indexing byname and indexing by position is discussed.cacm december 1972bayer r.witzgall c.address calculations algorithm transformation,compilation data structures indexing by name indexing by position index domain index map indexrange matrix expressions normal form programming languages program optimization range operations symbolicmanipulation syntactic analysis well-formed expressions4.12 4.22 5.14ca721202 jb january 27 1978 1:12 pm1614 4 22532253 4 22532253 4 22532254 4 22532557 4 22532081 5 22532253 5 22532253 5 22532253 5 2253437 5 2253
