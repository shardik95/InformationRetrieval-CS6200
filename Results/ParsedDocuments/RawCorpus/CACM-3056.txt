counting large numbers of events in small registersit is possible to use a small counter to keepapproximate counts of large numbers the resulting expected error can be rather precisely controlled anexample is given in which 8-bit counters bytes are used to keep track of as many as 130,000 events witha relative error which is substantially independent of the number n of events this relative error canbe expected to be 24 percent or less 95 percent of the time i.e.o  n/8 the techniques could be usedto advantage in multichannel counting hardware or software used for the monitoring of experiments or processes.cacm october 1978morris r.counting5.11ca781005 dh january 29 1979 5:52 pm3056 5 30563056 5 30563056 5 3056
