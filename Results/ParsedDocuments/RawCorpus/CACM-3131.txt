focus microcomputer number systemfocus is a number system and supporting computationalalgorithms especially useful for microcomputer control and othersignal processing applications focus has the wide-rangingcharacter of floating-point numbers with a uniformity of state distributionsthat give focus better than a twofold accuracy advantageover an equal word length floating-point system focus computationsare typically five times faster than single precision fixed-pointor integer arithmetic for a mixture of operations comparable inspeed with hardware arithmetic for many applications algorithmsfor 8-bit and 16-bit implementations of focus are included.cacm march 1979edgar a.lee s.number representation logarithmic arithmetic computationalspeed computational accuracy microcomputer applications 3.24 3.80 4.0 4.22 5.11ca790302 dh april 12 1979 11:12 am3131 4 31313131 4 31311148 5 31313131 5 31313131 5 31313131 5 3131893 5 3131
