the optimal approach to recursive programsthe classical fixed poin t approach toward recursiveprograms suggests choosing the least defined fixed poin t as the most appropriate solution to a recursiveprogram a new approach is described which in troduction an  optimal fixed point which in contrastto the least defined fixed poin t embodies the maximal amount of valuable information embedded in theprogram the practical implications of this approach are discussed and techniques for proving propertiesof optimal fixed poin t are given the presentation is informal with emphasis on examples.cacm november 1977manna z.shamir a.recursive programs fixed poin ts least fixedpoints,optimal fixed poin ts proof techniques5.24ca771109 jb december 27 1977 7:13 am2907 5 29072907 5 29072907 5 2907
