the multistore parser for hierarchical syntactic structuresa syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patternsthat are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings particularemphasis is given to the system of significant addresses by meansof which processing times for large-scale matching procedurescan be substantially reduced the description makes frequent useof examples taken from the fully operational implementation of theparser in an experimental english sentence analyzer by structuringan area of the computer's central core storage in such a waythat the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent thedata involved in the matching procedure the shifting of informationis reduced to a minimum and the searching of lists is eliminatedaltogether the matches are traced by means of binary masksand the state of single bits determines the operational flow of theprocedure the method could be implemented with any interpretivegrammar provided it can be expressed by the functional classificationof the items composing the input hierarchical structures.cacm february 1970von glasersfeld e.parsing syntactic analysis natural-language analysis linguistic dataprocessing computational linguistics correlational grammar structurerecognition pattern recognition matching procedures tree-structure interpretation machine translation automatic abstracting3.42 3.49 3.63 3.70 3.71ca700202 jb february 14 1978 12:57 pm 2113 5 21132113 5 21132113 5 2113
