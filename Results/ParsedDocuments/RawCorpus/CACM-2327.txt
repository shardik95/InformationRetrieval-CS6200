toward an automata theory of brainsa source of ideas for automata theory-the studyof the brain-has been pushed aside in mathematical development of the theory this paper suggests the waysin which automata theory might evolve over the next 25 years if it is to contribute to an understandingof how the brain processes information.cacm july 1972arbib m a.automata theory brain theory network complexity,resolution of redundancy of potential command frog visual system reticular formation mode selection3.36 3.65 5.22ca720701 jb january 30 1978 3:46 pm2327 5 23272327 5 23272327 5 2327
