context-sensitive parsingthis paper presents a canonical form for context-sensitivederivations and a parsing algorithm which findseach context-sensitive analysis once and only once the amount of memoryrequired by the algorithm is essentially no more than the required to store a single complete derivation in addition a modifiedversion of the basic algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses for grammars which contain loops the algorithm isalso compared with several previous parsers for context-sensitivegrammars and general rewriting systems and the difference betweenthe two types of analyses is discussed the algorithm appears tobe complementary to an algorithm by s kuno in several respects including the space-time trade-off and the degree of context dependence involved.cacm july 1970woods w a.context-sensitive grammars context-sensitive parsing formal grammars,formal language theory parsing parsing algorithms recognition algorithms3.42 5.22 5.23ca700707 jb february 10 1978 4:43 pm2030 5 20302030 5 20302030 5 2030
