memory management and response timethis paper presents a computationally tractablemethodology for including accurately the effects of finite memory size and workload memory requirementsin queueing network models of computer systems empirical analyses and analytic studies based on applyingthis methodology to an actual multiaccess in teractive system are reported relations between workloadvariables such as memory requirement distribution and job swap time and performance measures such as responsetime and memory utilization are graphically displayed a multiphase analytically soluble model isproposed as being broadly applicable to the analysis of in teractive computer systems which use nonpaged memories.cacm march 1977brown r m.browne j c.chandy k m.memory management system performance queueingnetwork models in teractive computer systems4.32ca770304 jb december 30 1977 12:51 am2988 4 29881750 5 29882988 5 29882988 5 29882988 5 29883059 5 29883070 5 29881805 6 29882454 6 29882741 6 29882988 6 29882988 6 2988
