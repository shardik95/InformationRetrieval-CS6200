descriptran-automated descriptive geometry*descriptive geometry consists of procedures originallydesigned to solve 3-space geometry problems by graphical constructions and measurement instead ofby computation however in addition to this it unifies and simplifies the approach to many such problems when one can call subroutines that compute new coordinates that correspond to those obtainable fromthe graphical constructions there is the three-way advantage of the approach of descriptive geometry theaccuracy of computation and the speed of the digital computer descriptran makes it possible to programmany problems in 3-space with a few statements it consists of 15 subroutines analogous to the procedures of descriptive geometry.cacm june 1963kliphardt r a.ca630625 jb march 14 1978 9:56 am824 5 824824 5 824824 5 824
