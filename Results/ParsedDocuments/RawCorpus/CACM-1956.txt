optimum merging from mass storagean algorithm is displayed which yields the merge orders such that the totalread time defined to be the sum of seek time plus data-transfertime is minimized for a sort using mass storage the analysis isparameterized in terms of the ratio of seek time to the time it takesto fill available core with records and the file size in unitsof core lengths and thus it can be applied to any conventionalcpu/mass storage combination an explicit formula for total readtime is derived in terms of the parameters which correlates verywell with the total read time calculated using the optimum mergeorders yielded by the algorithm the formula involves the roots of a simple transcendental equation a short table of these rootsis included numerical results are graphically displayed for a widerange of the parameters it is found that the normalized readtime for optimum merging on a given hardware configuration is proportionalto the file length times the logarithm of the file length.cacm december 1970black n a.sorting merging optimum merging mass storage,sort timing drum-merging access time3.37 4.49 5.31ca701207 jb february 9 1978 3:18 pm1956 4 19562017 4 19561956 5 19561956 5 19561956 5 1956854 5 1956
