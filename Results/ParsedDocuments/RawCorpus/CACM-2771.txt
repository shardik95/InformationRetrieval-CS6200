the synthesis of solids bounded by many facesa technique is presented which allows a classof solid objects to be synthesized and stored using a computer synthesis begins with primitive solidslike a cube wedge or cylinder any solid can be moved scaled or rotated solids may also beadded together or subtracted two algorithms to perform addition are described for practical designers,the technique has the advantage that operations are concise readily composed and are given in termsof easily imagined solidsuite short sequences of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces.cacm april 1975braid i c.computational geometry computer-aided design,graphics machined components polyhedra shape synthesis three-dimensional modeling3.2 8.2ca750406 jb january 9 1978 3:59 pm2771 5 27712771 5 27712771 5 27712827 5 27713116 5 27712751 6 27712771 6 27712771 6 2771
