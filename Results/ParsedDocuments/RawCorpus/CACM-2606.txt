a new integration algorithm for ordinary differentialequations based on continued fraction approximationsa new integration algorithm is found and animplementation is compared with other programmed algorithms the new algorithm is a step-by-step procedurefor solving the initial value problem in ordinary differential equations it is designed to approximatepoles of small integer order in the solutions of the differential equations by continued fractions obtainedby manipulating the sums of truncated taylor series expansions the new method is compared withgragg-bulirsh-stoer and the taylor series method the taylor series method and the new method are shownto be superior in speed and accuracy while the new method is shown to be most superior when the solutionis required near a singularity the new method can finally be seen to pass automatically through singularitieswhere all the other methods which are discussed will have failed.cacm september 1974willers i m.ordinary differential equations initial value problem,integration taylor series singularities continued fractions program comparison5.17ca740902 jb january 17 1978 9:06 am2606 5 26062606 5 26062606 5 2606
