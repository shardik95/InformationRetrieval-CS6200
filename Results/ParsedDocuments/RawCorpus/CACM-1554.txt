a computer technique for displaying n-dimensional hyperobjectsa digital computer and automatic plotter havebeen used to generate three-dimensional stereoscopic movies of the three-dimensional parallel and perspectiveprojections of four-dimensional hyperobjects rotating in four-dimensional space the observed projectionsand their motions were a direct extensionof three-dimensional experience but no profound feeling"or insight into the fourth spatial dimension was obtained the technique can be generalized to n-dimensionsand applied to any n-dimensional hyperobject or hypersurface.cacm august 1967noll a m.ca670801 jb february 27 1978 4:48 pm1554 5 15541554 5 15541554 5 15542211 5 15541554 6 15541741 6 1554
