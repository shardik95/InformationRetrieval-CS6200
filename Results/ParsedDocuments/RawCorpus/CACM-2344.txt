on the optimization of performance of time-sharing systems by simulationa simulation model of a time-sharing systemwith a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite auxiliary store is used to study the variation of systemparameters such as store size number of jobs allowed to execute simultaneously job-scheduling algorithm,etc the effects of these variations on a measure of system performance is used to ascertain whichof the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling algorithm including the scheduling itself require optimization,and which of the parameters not normally controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a markedeffect on system performance system performance is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed it is shown that significant improvements in the measure of system performance can be obtained byusing variable time-slice techniques and by selecting the optimum round-robin cycle time it appears that thesefeatures would benefit from optimization whereas other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithmaffect system performance in a predictable manner and would not benefit from optimization featuresnot normally under the control of the scheduling algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measureof performance in particular supervisor overheads the size of the store and the speed of the cpu a comparisonis made between the results of the simulation model and two analytical equations for quantum-orientednonpreemptive time-sharing systems the comparison is found to be very favorable.cacm june 1972blatny j.clark s r.rourke t a.time-sharing simulation studies optimization,measure of performance scheduling algorithms3.80 4.30 4.32ca720601 jb january 31 1978 9:19 am2219 4 23442344 4 23441938 5 23442344 5 23442344 5 23442344 5 2344
