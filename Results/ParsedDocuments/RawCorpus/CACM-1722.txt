methods of convergence improvement for some improper integralsin the numerical integration of an improperintegral of the first kind it is customary to truncate the integral when the change yielded by the lastiteration is less than some predetermined constant the efficiency of such integration schemes can oftenbe improved by use of recent advances in the theory of nonlinear transformations however for several importantintegrals e.g integrals whose integrands are rational polynomials these transformations failto yield much improvement in this paper several methods of convergence improvement are developed which greatlyimprove convergence of some improper integrals including the integrals of rational polynomials.cacm july 1968mcwilliams g v.thompson r w.approximation nonlinear improper integral convergenceimprovement numerical integration rational polynomials truncation3.15 5.13 5.16 5.19ca680707 jb february 22 1978 11:58 am1722 5 17221722 5 17221722 5 1722
