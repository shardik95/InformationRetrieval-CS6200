a parser-generating system for constructing compressed compilersthis paper describes a parser-generating system(pgs currently in use on the cdc-6500 computer at purdue university the pgs is a fortran-coded compiler in the input translation grammar each bnf syntactic rule corresponds to a possibly empty codegenerator realizable as an assembly language fortran or algol subroutine that is called wheneverthat syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a program typical one-pass compilers constructed by thepgs translate source programs at speeds approaching 14,000 cards per minute for an xpl compiler the parserprogram and its tables currently occupy 288 words of 60-bit core memory of which 140 words are parsingtable entries and 82 words are links to code generators.cacm november 1973mickunas m d.schneider v b.parser generators translator writing systems,syntactic analysis normal-form grammars pushdown automata translation grammars translator optimization compression algorithm4.12 5.22 5.23ca731103 jb january 20 197810:41 am2179 4 24232423 4 24232423 4 24231337 5 24232015 5 24232423 5 24232423 5 24232423 5 24232733 5 24231781 6 24232179 6 24232423 6 24232786 6 2423799 6 2423
