length of strings for a merge sortdetailed statistics are given on the lengthof maximal sorted strings which result form the first internal sort phase of a merge sort onto tapes it is shown that the strings produced by an alternating method i.e one which produces ascendingand descending strings alternately tend to be only three-fourths as long as those in a method which producesonly ascending strings contrary to statements which have appeared previously in the literature aslight modification of the read-backward polyphase merge algorithm is therefore suggested.cacm november 1963knuth d e.ca631115 jb march 13 1978 3:31 pm1117 4 6772017 4 6772146 4 677677 4 677860 4 6771638 5 6772176 5 6772272 5 677677 5 677677 5 677677 5 677861 5 6771638 6 677677 6 677677 6 677677 6 677
