initial experience with an operating multiprogramming systemthe lewis research center has been using variousforms and degrees of program simultaneity in the operation of its modified sperry-rand univac scientificmodel 1103 computer during the last five years this simultaneity has evolved from an initialachievement of self-searching input and output to the automatic time sharing of independently codedproblems several important machine and program system modifications were necessary to accomplish thisevolution several additional modifications although not required were added to facilitate easeof coding and operation all modifications had to proceed at a relatively temperate pace to insure thatthe basic data-reduction work load of the computing center was completed on schedule some educationallyvaluable mistakes were made and their suggested cures often pointed the way to useful future improvementsor emphasized some of the basic principles of a multiprogramming system the material that followsis a description of the evolution of the programming and hardware system which has developed into the presentmultiprogramming system at lewis research center.cacm may 1962landis n.manos a.turner l r.ca620520 jb march 17 1978 9:45 pm585 5 585585 5 585585 5 585
