computing polynomial resultants bezout's determinantvs collins reduced p algorithmalgorithms for computing the resultant of twopolynomials in several variables a key repetitive step of computation in solving systems of polynomialequations by elimination are studied determining the best algorithm for computer implementation dependsupon the extent to which extraneous factors are introduced the extent of propagation of errors caused bytruncation of real coefficients memory requirements and computing speed preliminary considerations narrowthe choice of the best algorithm to bezout's determinant and collins reduced polynomial remainder sequence(p.r.s algorithm detailed tests performed on sample problems conclusively show that bezout's determinantis superior in all respects except for univariate polynomials in which case collins reducedp.r.s algorithm is somewhat faster in particular bezout's determinant proves to be strikingly superior innumerical accuracy displaying excellent stability with regard to round-off errors results of tests are reported in detail.cacm january 1969ku s y.adler r j.resultant algorithm g.c.d algorithm polynomialresultant elimination bezout's determinant sylvester's determinant reduced p.r.s algorithm euclideanalgorithm multivariate polynomial equations4.40 5.10 5.15 5.41ca690103 jb february 20 1978 12:10 pm1024 4 19461051 4 19461098 4 19461214 4 19461380 4 19461388 4 19461393 4 19461396 4 19461396 4 19461485 4 19461487 4 19461549 4 19461570 4 19461878 4 19461931 4 19461946 4 19461946 4 19461946 4 19461946 4 19461946 4 19461946 4 19461946 4 19461946 4 19461957 4 19462167 4 19462168 4 19462723 4 19462857 4 19462857 4 19463112 4 1946902 5 19461093 5 19461177 5 19461393 5 19461387 5 19461946 5 19461946 5 19461946 5 1946360 5 1946731 5 1946878 5 1946
