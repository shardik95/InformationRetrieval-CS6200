the merit of regional computing networksone of the suggested means for stimulating thespread of computing capabilities in institutions of higher learning is through the construction of regionalcomputing networks one such network has been constructed in the san francisco bay area by stanforduniversity this paper reports upon the lessons learned from the operation of the network over the pasttwo years a major impact of the network was not so much the computer power delivered to the schoolsas the awakening of computing awareness and the fostering of capability development at these schools theexpertise and assistance from the central facilityas well as the sharing of ideas among the participantswere other important benefits both the quality and variety of services provided by the central facilitywere found to play a key role in the effectiveness of the network a regional network brings many benefitsand should not be judged as a purveyor of raw computer power alone.cacm may 1971nielsen n r.computer sharing computer utility cooperative networks,curriculum development educational computing network computing regional computing networks,remote computing shared computing1.52 2.11ca710502 jb february 3 1978 3:17 pm2197 5 21972197 5 21972197 5 2197
