interval arithmetic determinant evaluationand its use in testing for a chebyshev systemtwo recent papers one by hansen and one byhansen and r r smith have shown how interval arithmetic i can be used effectively to bound errorsin matrix computations in the present paper a method proposed by hasen and r r smith is comparedwith straightforward use of i in determinant evaluation computational results show the accuracyand running times that can be expected when using i for determinant evaluation an application usingi determinants in a program to test a set of functions to see if they form a chebyshev system is then presented.cacm february 1969smith l b.interval arithmetic range arithmetic error bounds,determinant evaluation chebyshev system mathematical proof by computer5.11 5.13 5.14ca690207 jb february 20 1978 10:49 am1524 4 19311931 4 19311931 4 19311946 4 19312214 4 19312544 4 19311177 5 19311931 5 19311931 5 19311931 5 1931311 5 1931
