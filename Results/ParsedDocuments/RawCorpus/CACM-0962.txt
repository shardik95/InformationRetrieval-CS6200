double-precision squares root for the cdc-3600in january of 1960 the late hans j maehly completeda summary of approximations to the elementary functions for the cdc-1604 computer the approximationsand techniques suggested by maehly are equally applicable to the second large computer in the cdc line,the 3600 unlike the 1604 however the 3600 has built-in double-precision floating-point arithmetic the present work largely inspired by the successes of maehly and his associates concerns the extension of oneof maehly's ideas to a double-precision subroutine for the 3600.cacm december 1964cody w j.ca641209 jb march 9 1978 3:31 pm962 5 962962 5 962962 5 9621440 5 9621932 5 9622159 5 962962 6 962962 6 962962 6 9621566 6 9621932 6 962532 6 962
