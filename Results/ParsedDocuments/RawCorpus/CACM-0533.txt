digital synthesis of correlated stationary noisein this note we propose a method of generatingstationary noise with a prescribed auto-covariance function by digital methods the need for such a techniqueoften arises in testing the performance of data processing and engineering systems where inputscorrupted with correlated noise of a known form are required the technique is quite simple and producesstrict-sense stationary noise which agrees approximately with r(t the prescribed auto-covariancefunction acf over an interval t(0 t(0 the method consists of approximating the spectral densityby a periodic process with spectral lines and then synthesizing the periodic noise with randomphases and appropriate amplitudes in order to simplify discussion of the statistical properties of thenoise generated the technique is first presented in terms of exact harmonic analysis in practice discreteharmonic analysis as presented in the third section is used.cacm july 1962peabody p r.adorno d s.ca620728 jb march 17 1978 7:59 pm533 5 533533 5 533533 5 533
