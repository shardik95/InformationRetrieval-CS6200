prevention of system deadlocksa well-known problem in the design of operatingsystems is the selection of a resource allocation policy that will prevent deadlock deadlock is thesituation in which resources have been allocated to various tasks in such a way that none of the taskscan continue the various published solutions have been somewhat restrictive either they do not handlethe problem in sufficient generality or they suggest policies which will on occasion refuse a requestwhich could have been safely granted algorithms are presented which examine a request in the light ofthe current allocation of resources and determine whether or not the granting of the request will introducethe possibility of a deadlock proofs given in the appendixes show that the conditions imposed bythe algorithms are both necessary and sufficient to prevent deadlock the algorithms have been successfully used in the the system cacm july 1969habermann a n.multiprogramming time-sharing scheduling resource allocation3.72 4.32 6.20ca690703 jb february 17 1978 9:33 am1458 4 18771523 4 18771603 4 18771698 4 18771747 4 18771748 4 18771828 4 18771854 4 18771854 4 18771877 4 18771877 4 18771960 4 18771960 4 18772150 4 18772317 4 18772319 4 18772377 4 18772377 4 18772378 4 18772342 4 18772376 4 18772379 4 18772424 4 18772482 4 18772497 4 18772558 4 18772618 4 18772625 4 18772632 4 18772632 4 18772704 4 18772723 4 18772738 4 18772740 4 18772741 4 18772840 4 18772867 4 18772941 4 18773105 4 18773144 4 18773184 4 18771471 5 18771749 5 18771877 5 18771877 5 18771877 5 18772228 5 18772280 5 18772379 5 18772482 5 18772740 5 18772851 5 18772920 5 18771198 6 18771338 6 18771749 6 18771749 6 18771749 6 18771877 6 18771877 6 18771877 6 18771877 6 18771877 6 18771877 6 18771877 6 18772080 6 18772150 6 18772228 6 18772228 6 18772228 6 1877
