a model for automating file and program design in business application systemsthis paper discusses a model for finding an efficient implementation of a business application system whose logical specifications have been determinedin advance the model views file and program design as a problemof systematically coordinating the configurations of datasets andcomputations it uses a straight forward search technique todetermine aggregations of computations aggregations of datasets device,organization and key order for each data set key order for each computation and access method for each dataset-computationpair although computational results are presented for a sampleproblem involving 54 computations and 49 datasets the main point ofthe paper is that the underlying model works computationally and is simple enough to be adapted to many file design situations.cacm june 1979alter s.system design automatic programming searchmethods system configurations design choices4.12 4.22 4.6ca790603 dh august 21 1979 4:25 pm3147 4 31472718 5 31473147 5 31473147 5 31473147 5 3147
