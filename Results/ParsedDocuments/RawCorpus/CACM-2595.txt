a note on the calculation working set sizefinite-length reference string of arbitrarystructure are considered and an exact expression for average working set size in terms of corrected"interreference interval statistics is derived an example is discussed upper and lower bounds are obtained;and the average working set size function is shown to be efficiently obtained for a set of pagesizes in a single pass of the reference string this work follows the developments of a paper by denningand schwartz who consider infinite-length reference strings which satisfy certain statisticalproperties and who derive an expression relating the asymptotic average working set size to the asymptoticmissing page rate function under working set replacement.cacm october 1974slutz d r.traiger i l.working-set model paging program behavior4.3ca741003 jb january 16 1978 12:56 pm2374 4 25952380 4 25952450 4 25952595 4 25952996 4 25953006 4 25953067 4 25952373 5 25952595 5 25952595 5 25952595 5 25952996 5 25953006 5 25953067 5 25951751 6 25951751 6 25951751 6 25951884 6 25952374 6 25952374 6 25952373 6 25952373 6 25952373 6 25952595 6 25952595 6 25952595 6 25952682 6 25952863 6 25952864 6 25953006 6 2595
