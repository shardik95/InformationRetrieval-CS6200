an anomaly in space-time characteristics ofcertain programs running in a paging machinethe running time of programs in a paging machinegenerally increases as the store in which programs are constrained to run decreases experiments,however have revealed cases in which the reverse is true a decrease in the size of the store is accompaniedby a decrease in running time an informal discussion of the anomalous behavior is given and forthe case of the fifo replacement algorithm a formal treatment is presented.cacm june 1969belady l a.nelson r a.shedler g s.paging machines demand paging replacement algorithm4.30ca690609 jb february 17 1978 9:59 am1879 4 18841884 4 18841901 4 18842095 4 18842277 4 18842297 4 18842365 4 18841754 5 18841884 5 18841884 5 18841884 5 18842022 5 18842085 5 18843006 5 18841751 6 18841751 6 18841884 6 18841884 6 18841884 6 18842374 6 18842373 6 18842595 6 1884
