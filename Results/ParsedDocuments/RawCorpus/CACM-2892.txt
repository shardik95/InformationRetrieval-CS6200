a study of line overhead in the arpanetthe form extent and effect of the communication lineoverhead in the arpanet are considered the source of this over head is separated into variouslevels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics of each level are summarized then the line efficiencyfor various models of system use is studied some measurements of line efficiency for the arpanet arepresented and by extrapolation these measurements are used to anticipate overhead in a heavily loaded network.similar results are derived for a recently proposed network protocol and compared with those for the current system.cacm january 1976kleinrock l.naylor w e.opderbeck h.arpanet computer communication networks interprocesscommunication measurement packet switching performance evaluation and efficiency resource sharing3.81 4.39 4.6 4.9ca760101 jb january 5 1978 10:49 am2892 5 28922892 5 28922892 5 2892
