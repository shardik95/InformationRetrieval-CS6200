some techniques for using pseudorandom numbers in computer simulationan algorithm is described by which uniform pseudorandomintegers may be used to construct binary numbers in which the probability that each bit in theword is a 1-bit and can assume any desired parameter value techniques for making use of such numbers"in simulation programming are described.cacm july 1969donnelly t.random numbers simulation boolean algebra bit manipulation5.19 5.39ca690710 jb february 17 1978 8:54 am1794 4 18701870 4 18702122 4 18701674 5 18701870 5 18701870 5 18701870 5 1870
