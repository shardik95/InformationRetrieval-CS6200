solution of systems of polynomial equations by eliminationthe elimination procedure as described by williamshas been coded in lisp and formac and used in solving systems of polynomial equations it is foundthat the method is very effective in the case of small systems where it yields all solutions withoutthe need for initial estimates the method by itself appears in appropriate however in the solutionof large systems of equation due to the explosive growth in the intermediate equations and the hazardswhich arise when the coefficients are truncated a comparison is made with difficulties found in otherproblems in non-numerical mathematics such as symbolic integration and simplification.cacm august 1966moses j.ca660811 jb march 2 1978 7:11 pm1396 5 13871387 5 13871387 5 13871387 5 13871946 5 1387878 6 1387902 6 1387964 6 13871028 6 13871029 6 13871083 6 13871093 6 13871132 6 13871177 6 13871214 6 13871278 6 13871334 6 13871365 6 13871386 6 13871387 6 13871387 6 13871388 6 13871392 6 13871393 6 13871393 6 13871394 6 13871395 6 13871396 6 13871397 6 13871496 6 1387284 6 1387360 6 1387407 6 13873199 6 13873200 6 13873201 6 13873202 6 13873203 6 13873204 6 1387561 6 1387730 6 1387731 6 1387
