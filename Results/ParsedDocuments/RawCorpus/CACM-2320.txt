structured multiprogrammingthis paper presents a proposal for structuredrepresentation of multiprogramming in a high level language the notation used explicitly associatesa data structure shared by concurrent processes with operations defined on it this clarifies the meaningof programs and permits a large class of time-dependent errors to be caught at compile time a combination ofcritical regions and event variables enables the programmer to control scheduling of resources amongcompeting processes to any degree desired these concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only withinoperating systems but also within user programs.cacm july 1972hansen p b.structured multiprogramming programming languages,operating systems concurrent processes shared data mutual exclusion critical regions processcommunication synchronizing events.4.2 4.3ca720708 jb january 30 1978 2:39 pm2319 4 23202378 4 23202320 4 23202320 4 23202597 4 23202632 4 23202738 4 23202740 4 23202777 4 23202851 4 23202868 4 23202895 4 23202912 4 23202946 4 23203127 4 23203128 4 23202080 5 23202150 5 23202320 5 23202320 5 23202320 5 23202597 5 23202150 6 23202320 6 2320
