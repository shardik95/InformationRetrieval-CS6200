database abstractions aggregationaggregation is in troduced as an abstractionwhich is important in conceptualizing the real world aggregation transforms a relationship betweenobjects into a higher-level object a new data type called aggregation is developed which undercertain criteria of well-definedness specifies aggregation abstractions relational databases definedas collections of aggregates are structured as a hierarchy on n-ary relations to main tain well-definedness,update operations on such databases must preserve two invariants well-defined relations aredistinct from relations in third normal form it is shown that these notions are complementary and both areimportant in database design a top-down methodology for database design is described which separatesdecisions concerning aggregate structure from decisions concerning key identification it issuggested that aggregate types and other types which support real-world abstractions without in troducingimplementation detail should be incorporated into programming languages.cacm june 1977smith j m.smith d c p.data abstraction relational database data type,aggregation database design data structure knowledge representation data definition language3.65 3.69 3.79 4.29 4.33 4.34ca770606 jb december 29 1977 12:33 am2155 4 29572406 4 29572710 4 29572715 4 29572716 4 29572717 4 29572718 4 29572765 4 29572817 4 29572888 4 29572901 4 29572957 4 29572959 4 29572965 4 29573087 4 29573154 4 29572046 5 29572957 5 29572957 5 29572957 5 29573049 5 29572956 6 29572958 6 29572957 6 29572960 6 2957
