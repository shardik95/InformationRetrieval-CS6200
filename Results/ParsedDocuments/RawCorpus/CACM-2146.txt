optimizing the polyphase sortvarious dispersion algorithms for the polyphasesorting procedure are examinedhe optimum algorithm based on minimizing the total number of unitstrings read is displayed the logic of this algorithm is rather complicated hence several othernew dispersion algorithms with more straightforward logic are presented of the simple dispersion algorithmsdiscussed the horizontal is best it does approximately one-fourth to one and one-half percentless reading and writing than most algorithms in use today an additional two and one-fourth to threepercent improvement can be achieved by utilizing the modified optimum algorithm this algorithm is relativelystraightforward but it requires a fairly close estimate of the total number of unit strings before the dispersion begins.cacm november 1971shell d l.sorting polyphase sorting dispersion algorithms,optimum dispersion algorithm repetition operator5.31ca711103 jb february 2 1978 11:39 am1117 4 21461117 4 21462017 4 21462017 4 21462017 4 21462146 4 21462146 4 21462146 4 21462146 4 2146479 4 2146677 4 2146860 4 2146861 4 2146862 4 2146863 4 2146299 5 21462146 5 21462146 5 21462146 5 2146862 5 2146863 5 2146861 5 2146
