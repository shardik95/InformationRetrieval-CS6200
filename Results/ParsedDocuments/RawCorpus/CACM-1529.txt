decomposition programming an analysis of matrix substructure a petroleum blending problem was analyzed in orderto compare the primal and primal-dual decomposition algorithms in the course of the analysis a substructurewas discovered which has relevance to the relative performance of the two algorithms and to theirabsolute performance as compared with a standard primal-simplex solution without decomposition.cacm october 1967bell e j.ca671004 jb february 27 1978 2:33 pm1529 5 15291529 5 15291529 5 1529
