an improvement to iterative methods of polynomial factorizationmethods of polynomial factorization whichfind the zeros one at a time require the division of the polynomial by the accepted factor it is shownhow the accuracy of this division may be increased by dividing in order of both ascending and descendingpowers of the variable and choosing a crossover point which minimizes a very simply calculated error criterion.cacm january 1967bingham j a c.ca670112 jb february 28 1978 4:20 pm1643 5 16431643 5 16431643 5 1643
