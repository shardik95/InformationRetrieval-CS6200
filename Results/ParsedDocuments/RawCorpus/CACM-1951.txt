estimates of distributions of random variablesfor certain computer communications traffic modelsa study of multiaccess computer communications hascharacterized the distributions underlying an elementary model of the user-computer interactive process the model used iselementary in the sense that many of the random variables thatgenerally are of interest in computer communications studies can bedecomposed into the elements of this model data were examinedfrom four operational multiaccess systems and the model is shown tobe robust that is each of the variables of the model has thesame distribution independent of which of the four systems is being examined it is shown that the gamma distribution can be used todescribe the discrete variables approximations to the gamma distributionby the exponential distribution are discussed for the systems studied.cacm december 1970fuchs e.jackson p e.computer communications time-sharing,operating systems optimization models3.80 3.81 6.20ca701212 jb february 9 1978 2:46 pm1533 4 19511604 4 19511951 4 19511951 4 19512373 4 19512667 4 19512668 4 19511410 5 19511604 5 19511951 5 19511951 5 19511951 5 19512373 5 19512894 5 19511410 6 19511751 6 19511810 6 19511951 6 19511951 6 19512016 6 19512374 6 1951
