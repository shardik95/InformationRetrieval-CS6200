a method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystemsan encryption method is presented with the novelproperty that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryptionkey this has two important consequences 1 couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmitkeys since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient only he can decipher the message since only he knows the corresponding decryption key 2)a message can be signed using a privately held decryption key anyone can verify this signature usingthe corresponding publicly revealed encryption key signatures cannot be forged and a signer cannotlater deny the validity of his signature this has obvious applications in electronic mail and electronicfunds transfer systems a message is encrypted by representing it as a number m raisingm to a publicly specified power e and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publiclyspecified product n of two large secret prime numbers p and q decryption is similar;only a different,secret power d is used where e  d  1 mod(p-1  q-1 the security of the system rests in part onthe difficulty of factoring the published divisor n.cacm february 1978rivest r.shamir a.adleman l.digital signatures public-key cryptosystems,privacy authentication security factorization prime number electronic mail message-passing,electronic funds transfer cryptography.2.12 3.15 3.50 3.81 5.25ca780202 jb march 28 1978 4:40 pm3021 4 30213158 4 30213021 5 30213021 5 30213021 5 30213038 5 30213111 5 30213177 5 30213021 6 30213021 6 30213021 6 3021
