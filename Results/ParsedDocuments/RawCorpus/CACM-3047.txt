using synthetic images to register real images with surface modelsa number of image analysis tasks can benefitfrom registration of the image with a model of the surface being imaged automatic navigation using visiblelight or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with digital terrain models in addition,automatic classification of terrain using satellite imagery requires such alignment to deal correctlywith the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope even inspection techniques for certainindustrial parts may be improved by this means we achieve the required alignment by matching the realimage with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources thesynthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map a convenient way of describing surface reflectionas a function of surface gradient we illustrate the technique using landsat images and digital terrain models.cacm november 1978horn b.bachman b.image registration synthetic images surface models,automatic hill shading digital terrain models image transformation image matching shaded images 3.63 3.11 3.14 8.2 3.83ca781104 dh january 26 1979 11:16 am2816 4 30472816 4 30472828 4 30472827 4 30472913 4 30473047 4 30473047 4 30472751 5 30472829 5 30473047 5 30473047 5 30473047 5 3047
