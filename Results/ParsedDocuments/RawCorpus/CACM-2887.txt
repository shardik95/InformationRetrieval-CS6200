a study of errors error-proneness and error diagnosis in cobolthis paper provides data on cobol error frequencyfor correction of errors in student-oriented compilers improvement of teaching and changes in programminglanguage cobol was studied because of economic importance widespread usage possible error-includingdesign and lack of research the types of errors were identified in a pilot study then usingthe 132 error types found 1,777 errors were classified in 1,4000 runs of 73 cobol students errordensity was high 20 percent of the types contained 80 percent of the total frequency which implies highpotential effectiveness for software based correction of cobol surprisingly only four high-frequency errorswere error-prone which implies minimal error inducing design 80 percent of cobol misspellings were classifiablein the four error categories of previous researchers which implies that cobol misspellingsare correctable by existent algorithms reserved word usage was not error-prone which implies minimalinterference with usage of reserved words over 80 percent of error diagnosis was found to be inaccurate such feedback is not optimal for users particularly for the learning user of cobol.cacm january 1976litecky c r.davis g b.errors in programming error correction cobol programminglanguage errors error analysis diagnostics error-proneness error frequency spelling errors syntacticerrors learning of programming teaching of programming4.22 4.2 4.6ca760106 jb january 5 1978 10:06 am2534 4 28872556 4 28872650 4 28872708 4 28872887 4 28872887 4 28871646 5 28872111 5 28872887 5 28872887 5 28872887 5 28873145 5 28872887 6 2887
