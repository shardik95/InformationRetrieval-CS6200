an approximate method for generating symmetric random variablesa method for generating values of continuoussymmetric random variables that is relatively fast requires essentially no computer memory and iseasy to use is developed the method which uses a uniform zero-one random number source is based onthe inverse function of the lambda distribution of turkey since it approximates many of the continuoustheoretical distributions and empirical distributions frequently used in simulations the method shouldbe useful to simulation practitioners.cacm november 1972ramberg j s.schmeiser b w.simulation monte carlo probability statistics,approximations random variables random numbers moments distribution5.5 8.1ca721108 jb january 27 1978 1:47 pm2261 5 22612261 5 22612261 5 22612686 5 22612261 6 2261
