a case study in programming for parallel-processorsan affirmative partial answer is provided tothe question of whether it is possible to program parallel-processor computing systems to efficiently decreaseexecution time for useful problems parallel-processor systems are multiprocessor systems in which several ofthe processors can simultaneously execute separate tasks of a single job thus cooperating to decreasethe solution time of a computational problem the processors have independent instruction counters meaningthat each processor executes its own task program relatively independently of the other processors communicationbetween cooperating processors is by means of data in storage shared by all processors aprogram for the determination of the distribution of current in an electrical network was written for aparallel-processor computing system and execution of this program was simulated the data gathered fromsimulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution of this problem typical of a large class of importantproblems it is shown that with proper programming solution time when n processors are applied approaches1/n times the solution time for a single processor while improper programming can actually lead to an increaseof solution time with the number of processors stability of the method of solution was also investigated.cacm december 1969rosenfeld j l.parallel-processor parallelism parallel programming,multiprocessor multiprogramming tasking storage interference electrical network simulation,relaxation jacobi gauss-seidel convergence3.24 4.9 5.14 5.17 6.21ca691201 jb february 15 1978 4:45 pm1811 5 18111811 5 18111811 5 1811
