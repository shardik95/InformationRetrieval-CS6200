a process for the determination ofaddresses in variable length addressingan algorithm is presented for the assignmentof instruction addresses and formats under the following conditions 1 the length of the instruction variesas a function of the distance of the instruction from its target 2 there exists an optimality criterionwhich implies some preferential choices subject to the addressing constraints this may be for example,achieving the smallest number of long instructions in which case the total code length is minimized orminimizing the assigned address of a specified point in the program the algorithm is suitable for arbitraryprogram structure and a choice of optimization criteria.cacm june 1976frieder g.saal h j.variable length addressing assembler paging4.11 4.12ca760604 jb january 4 1978 2:09 pm2858 4 28583110 4 28582194 5 28582858 5 28582858 5 28582858 5 28583110 5 28582194 6 28582629 6 28582858 6 2858
