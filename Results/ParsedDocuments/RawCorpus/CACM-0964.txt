mechanization of tedious algebra-thee coefficients of theoretical chemistrya table of formulas for certain integralsinvolving legendre functions has been constructed mechanically by a program which performed algebraic operations the formulas are all rational algebraic expressions in a single variable and were constructedby a recurrence procedure they are of interest in molecular quantum chemistry trivial coding techniqueswere used to write the relevant programs in fortran the results were photo composed on a photons-560 system that was controlled by tapes which were punched directly from the computer output soavoiding manual keyboarding transcription errors and keyboarded correction.cacm december 1964wactlar h d.barnett m p.ca641207 jb march 9 1978 3:38 pm1028 4 9641121 4 9641216 4 9641392 4 9641396 4 9641396 4 964659 4 964964 4 964964 4 964964 4 964964 5 964964 5 964964 5 9641334 5 9641396 5 964284 5 9641444 5 964561 5 964759 5 964964 6 964964 6 964964 6 9641028 6 9641029 6 9641083 6 9641132 6 9641214 6 9641278 6 9641334 6 9641365 6 9641386 6 9641387 6 9641388 6 9641392 6 9641393 6 9641394 6 9641395 6 9641396 6 9641397 6 9641496 6 964284 6 964407 6 9643199 6 9643200 6 9643201 6 9643202 6 9643203 6 9643204 6 964561 6 964730 6 964
