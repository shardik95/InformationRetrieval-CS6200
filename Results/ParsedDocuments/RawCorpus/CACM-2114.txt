a formal system for information retrieval from filesa generalized file structure is providedby which the concepts of keyword index record file directory,file structure directory decoding and record retrieval are definedand from which some of the frequently used file structures suchas inverted files index-sequential files and multilist files arederived two algorithms which retrieve records from the generalized file structure are presented.cacm february 1970hsiao d.attribute-value pair index keyword record record address,k-pointer k-list file directory generalized filestructure inverted file index-sequential-file multilist file,description file search directory search serial processing oflists prime keyword parallel processing of lists 3.70 3.73 3.74ca700201 jb february 14 1978 1:04 pm2114 5 21142114 5 21142114 5 21142160 5 21142688 5 21142114 6 21142114 6 2114
