representation of many-sided polygonsand polygonal lines for rapid processinga representation for polygons and polygonallines is described which allows sets of consecutive sides to be collectively examined the set of sides arearranged in a binary tree hierarchy by inclusion a fast algorithm for testing the inclusion of a poin tin a many-sided polygon is given the speed of the algorithm is discussed for both ideal and practicalexamples it is shown that the poin ts of intersection of two polygonal lines can be located by what is essentiallya binary tree search the algorithm and a practical example are discussed the representationovercomes many of the disadvantages associated with the various fixed-grid methods for representing curves and regionscacm march 1977burton w.boundary line representation cartography computergraphics computer-searchable structures contour representation geographic information processing graphicdata retrieval in tersection of curves line-drawing processing poin ts in polygons regional boundaryrepresentation spatial information3.14 3.23 3.30 3.79 8.2ca770305 jb december 30 1977 12:44 am1630 4 29871804 4 29871804 4 29872547 4 29872987 4 29872987 4 29872987 4 29872987 4 29872987 4 29872987 4 29872987 4 29873165 4 29871326 5 29871630 5 29872125 5 29872547 5 29872633 5 29872987 5 29872987 5 29872987 5 2987421 5 2987524 5 29873165 5 29871326 6 29872987 6 2987
