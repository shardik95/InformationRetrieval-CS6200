a vector space model for automatic indexingin a document retrieval or other pattern matchingenvironment where stored entities documents are compared with each other or with incoming patterns(search requests it appears that the best indexing property space is one where each entity lies as far awayfrom the others as possible in these circumstances the value of an indexing system may be expressibleas a function of the density of the object space in particular retrieval performance may correlate inverselywith space density an approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimumindexing vocabulary for a collection of documents typical evaluation results are shown demonstratingthe usefulness of the model.cacm november 1975salton g.wong a.yang c s.automatic information retrieval automaticindexing content analysis document space3.71 3.73 3.74 3.75ca751101 jb january 6 1978 10:14 am2711 5 27112711 5 27112711 5 2711
