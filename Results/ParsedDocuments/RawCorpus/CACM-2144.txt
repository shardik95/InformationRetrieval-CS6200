on accurate floating-point summationthe accumulation of floating-point sums isconsidered on a computer which performs t-digit base b floating-point addition with exponents in the range-m to m an algorithm is given for accurately summing n t-digit floating-point numbers each ofthese n numbers is split into q parts forming qn t-digit floating-point numbers each of these is thenadded to the appropriate one of n auxiliary t-digit accumulators finally the accumulators are added togetherto yield the computed sum in all qn+n-1 t-digit floating-point additions are performed underusual conditions the relative error in the computed sum is at most t+1)v]b^1-t for some v further,with an additional q+n-1 t-digit additions the computed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy for example for the ibm/360 b=16 t=14 m=63 m=64 typical values for q and n are q=2 and n=32 in this case  becomes n  32,768 and we have t+1)v]b^1-t  4x16^13.cacm november 1971malcolm m a.floating-point summation error analysis5.11 5.19ca711105 jb february 2 1978 10:48 am1328 4 21441333 4 21442144 4 21441052 5 21442144 5 21442144 5 21442144 5 2144
