designing surfaces in 3-dan experimental system for computer-aideddesign of free-form surfaces in three dimensions is described the surfaces are represented in the systemas parametric basis splines the principal features of the system are 1 the surfaces are rendered as isoparametricline drawings on a head-mounted display and they are designed with the aid of a three-dimensional"wand which allows 3-d movements of the points controlling the shapes of the surfaces 2 all of theinteractions with the surfaces are in real-time and 3 the mathematical formulations used assume noknowledge of them by the user of the system also examined are some of the features that should be partof a practical 3-d system for designing space-forms.cacm august 1976clark j h.real-time graphics computer-aided design,picture processing b-splines 3-d displays3.80 6.22 8.2ca760803 jb january 4 1978 10:25 am2828 5 28412841 5 28412841 5 28412841 5 28411751 6 28412004 6 28412751 6 28412841 6 2841
