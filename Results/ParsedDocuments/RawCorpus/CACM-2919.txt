the programmer's workbench-a machine for software developmenton almost all software development projects theassumption is made that the program development function will be done on the same machine on which theeventual system will run it is only when this production machine is unavailable or when its programmingenvironment is totally inadequate that alternatives are considered in this paper it is suggested thatthere are many other situations where it would be advantageous to separate the program development andmain tenance function onto a specialized computer which is dedicated to that purpose such a computeris here called a programmer's workbench the four basic sections of the paper in troduce the subject,outlinethe general concept discuss areas where such an approach may prove beneficial and describean operational system utilizing this concept.cacm october 1977ivie e l.computer configurations computer networks softwaredevelopment software engineering software main tenance unix3.2 3.5 3.7 3.8 4.0ca771007 jb december 27 1977 10:37 am2626 4 29192786 4 29192840 4 29192919 4 29192919 4 29192919 4 29193017 4 29193110 4 29193174 4 29192536 5 29192593 5 29192629 5 29192919 5 29192919 5 29192919 5 2919
