the composition of semantics in algol 68the main features of algol 68 are explainedfrom a semantic point of view it is shown how the language permits the composition of values and actions,i.e ultimately programs from a minimum set of primitives with a few fundamental recursive rulesof composition the associated syntax is briefly reviewed an attempt has been made to obtain a structuredand simple introduction to both algol 68 and its orthogonal design.cacm november 1971branquart p.lewi j.sintzoff m.wodon p l.programming primitives programming languages,algol semantics recursive composition design of programming languages data structures1.3 4.2 4.22 5.23 5.24ca711101 jb february 2 1978 11:49 am2148 5 21482148 5 21482148 5 21482314 5 21482317 5 21482842 5 21481098 6 21481198 6 21481572 6 21481626 6 21481693 6 21481749 6 21481753 6 21481781 6 2148210 6 21482060 6 21482082 6 21482126 6 21482148 6 21482148 6 21482148 6 21482192 6 21483184 6 2148
