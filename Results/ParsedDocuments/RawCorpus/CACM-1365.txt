eliminating monotonous mathematics with formacthe formac formula manipulation compiler)programming system provides a powerful tool for performing mathematical analysis it is an extensionof fortran iv which permits the use of the computer to perform the tedious algebraic computations that arisein many different fields among the areas in which it has been successfully used are differentiationof complicated expressions expansion of truncated power series solution of simultaneous equations withliteral coefficients nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation tensor analysis and generation of the coefficientsof equations in keplerian motion these types of analysis-which arose in the solution of specificpractical problems in physics engineering astronomy statistics and astronautics-are discussed inthe paper in addition to its usage for specific problem solutions formac can also be used to automatethe analysis phase in certain production programming several such applications are presented.cacm october 1966tobey r g.ca661002 jb march 2 1978 4:14 pm1396 5 13651365 5 13651365 5 13651365 5 13652229 5 1365964 6 13651028 6 13651029 6 13651083 6 13651132 6 13651214 6 13651278 6 13651334 6 13651365 6 13651365 6 13651386 6 13651387 6 13651388 6 13651392 6 13651393 6 13651394 6 13651395 6 13651396 6 13651397 6 13651496 6 1365284 6 1365407 6 13653199 6 13653200 6 13653201 6 13653202 6 13653203 6 13653204 6 1365561 6 1365730 6 1365
