analysis of algorithms for the zero-one programming problemthis paper is concerned with a review and examinationof several existing algorithms for the zero-one programming problem computational experienceis summarized the machine time and storage requirements of several of the algorithms are comparedover several test problems of small and intermediate size computer experiments still provide little hopeof solving problems with over 100 variables with a reasonable amount of machine time.cacm december 1968gue r l.liggett j c.cain k c.operations research optimization theory integerprogramming zero-one variables algorithms5.39 5.41ca681208 jb february 21 1978 1:31 pm1658 4 16581088 5 16581658 5 16581658 5 16581658 5 16582226 5 16581658 6 16581666 6 1658
