finding zeros of a polynomial by the q-d algorithma method which finds simultaneously all the zerosof a polynomial developed by h rutishauser has been tested on a number of polynomials with realcoefficients this slowly converging method the quotient-difference q-d algorithm provides startingvalues for a newton or a bairstow algorithm for more rapid convergence necessary and sufficient conditionsfor the existence of the q-d scheme are not completely known however failure may occur whenzeros have equal or nearly equal magnitudes success was achieved in most of the cases tried withthe failures usually traceable to the equal magnitude difficulty in some cases computer roundoff may resultin errors which spoil the scheme even if the q-d algorithm does not give all the zeros,it will usually find a majority of them.cacm september 1965henrich p.watkins b o.ca650908 jb march 6 1978 7:21 pm1197 5 11971197 5 11971197 5 11971524 5 1197879 6 11971197 6 1197311 6 1197
