remarks on the practical solution of characteristic value problemsthis paper is concerned with the practicalsolution of characteristic value problem for an ordinary differential equation it is at once apparentthat sequential computers be they digital or analog solve initial value problems rather than boundaryvalue problems and some mathematical process must be found to compensate for the machine's inadequacy compensating for machine imperfection is of course the normal activity of the numerical analyst a number of other papers have applied particular devices to particular problems the purpose of thisnote is to establish a mathematical framework or model for these practical procedures and thus assist inthe use and extension of the ideas in other particular problems.cacm june 1959wouk a.ca590606 jb march 22 1978 6:30 pm78 5 7878 5 7878 5 78
