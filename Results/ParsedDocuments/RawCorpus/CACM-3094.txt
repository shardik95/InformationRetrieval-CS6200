analyses of deterministic parsing algorithmsthis paper describes an approach for determiningthe minimum maximum and average times to parse sentences acceptable by a deterministic parser these quantities are presented in the form of symbolic formulas called time-formulas the variablesin these formulas represent not only the length of the input string but also the time to perform elementaryoperations such as pushing popping subscripting iterating etc by binding to the variables actual numericalvalues corresponding to a given compiler-machine configuration one can determine the execution timefor that configuration time-formulas are derived by examining the grammar rules and the program representingthe algorithm one wishes to analyze the approach is described by using a specific grammar that definessimple arithmetic expressions two deterministicparsers are analyzed a top-down recursive descentll(1 parser and a bottom-up slr(1 parser the paper provides estimates for the relative efficienciesof the two parsers the estimates applicable to a specific machine the pdp-10 are presented andsubstantiated buy benchmarks finally the paper illustrates the proposed approach by applying it tothe analyses of parsers for a simple programming language cacm june 1978cohen j.roth m.syntactic analysis analysis of algorithms,top-downand bottom-up parsing relative efficiencies.4.12 5.23 5.24 5.25 5.7ca780603 dh february 26 1979 12:32 pm1350 4 30941399 4 30941659 4 30941768 4 30941781 4 30941945 4 30942110 4 30942719 4 30942733 4 30942986 4 30943093 4 30943094 4 30943094 4 30943094 4 30941265 5 30942179 5 30942645 5 30943094 5 30943094 5 30943094 5 3094
