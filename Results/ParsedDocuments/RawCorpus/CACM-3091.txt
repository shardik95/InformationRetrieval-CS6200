some basic determinants of computer programming productivitythe propose of this research was to examinethe relationship between processing characteristics of programs and experience characteristics of programmersand program development time the ultimate objective was to develop a technique for predictingthe amount of time necessary to create a computer program the fifteen program characteristics hypothesizedas being associated with an increase in programming time required are objectively measurable from preprogrammingspecifications the five programmer characteristics are experience-related and are also measurable before a programmingtask is begun nine program characteristics emerged as major influences on program development time,each associated with increased program development time all five programmer characteristics were foundto be related to reduced program development time a multiple regression equation which contained one programmercharacteristic and four program characteristics gave evidence of good predictive power forforecasting program development time cacm june 1978chrysler e.programmer performance standards predicting programdevelopment time program estimation techniques program development equation value of programming experience,programmer evaluation programmer scheduling programmer productivity programming management cobol programming2.40 4.20ca780606 dh february 26 1979 11:42 am3091 4 30911792 5 30913091 5 30913091 5 30913091 5 3091
