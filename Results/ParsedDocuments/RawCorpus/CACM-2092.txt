a deductive question-answer for natural language inferencethe question-answering aspects of the protosynthex iii prototype language processing system are described and exemplified indetail the system is written in lisp 1.5 and operates on the q-32time-sharing system the system's data structures and their semanticorganization the deductive question-answering formalism ofrelational properties and complex-relation-forming operators andthe question-answering procedures which employ these features intheir operation are all described and illustrated examples of thesystem's performance and of the limitations of its question-answering capability are presented and discussed it is shown that theuse of semantic information in deductive question answering greatly facilitates the process and that a top-down procedure which worksfrom question to answer enables effective use to be made of thisinformation it is concluded that the development of protosynthexiii into a practically useful system to work with large databases is possible but will require changes in both the datastructures and the algorithms used for question answering.cacm march 1970schwarcz r m.burger j f.simmons r f.question answering natural language protosynthex iii lisp,semantics artificial intelligence computationallinguistics language processing fact retrieval3.42 3.61ca700306 jb february 13 1978 4:30 pm2092 4 20922127 4 20921527 5 20922092 5 20922092 5 20922092 5 20922396 5 20921487 6 20921856 6 20922092 6 20922127 6 2092
