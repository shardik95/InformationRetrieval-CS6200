an implementation of structured walk-throughsin teaching cobol programmingthe effectiveness of structuredwalk-throughs in teaching introductory cobol programming was empiricallyassessed with a sample of 215 under-graduate business administrationmajors cobol proficiency was measured by a final examinationtesting a knowledge of language rules b ability to readand debug a program and c the ability to write a program analysisof multiple covariance was used to statistically adjust testscores for age and conditional reasoning scores the findings provideempirical support for incorporating structured walk-throughsinto the programming learning process more effectivelydevelop student proficiency in writing cobol programs.cacm june 1979lemos r.structured walk-throughs cobol programming teachingof programming testing programming proficiency3.51 1.52 2.42 4.22ca790601 dh august 21 1979 3:19 pm3145 4 31452887 5 31453145 5 31453145 5 31453145 5 3145
