experiments with an automatic theorem-proverhavingpartial ordering inference rulesautomatic theorem-provers need to be made muchmore efficient with this in mind slagle has shown how the axioms for partial ordering can be replacedby built-in inference rules when using a particular theorem-proving algorithm based upon hyper-resolution andparamodulation the new rules embody the transitivity of partial orderings and the close relationship between predicates a program has been developed using a modified version of these rules this new theorem-proverhas been found to be very powerful for solving problems involving partial orderings this paper presentsa detailed description of the program and a comprehensive account of the experiments that have been performed with it.cacm november 1973slagle j r.norton l m.theorem-proving partial ordering resolution,hyper-resolution p1-resolution paramodulation,inference rules heuristics3.64 3.66ca731106 jb january 20 1978 10:10 am2356 4 24202420 4 24202874 4 24203143 4 24202227 5 24202420 5 24202420 5 24202420 5 2420
