new sufficient optimality conditions forinteger programming and their applicationthe purpose of this report is to present anew class of sufficient optimality conditions for pure and mixed integer programming problems some ofthe sets of sufficient conditions presented can be thought of as generalizations of optimality conditionsbased on primal-dual complementarity in linear programming these sufficient conditions are particularlyuseful for the construction of difficult integer programming problems with known optimal solutions theseproblems may then be used to test and/or benchmark integer programming codes.cacm may 1978fleisher j.meyer r.integer programming optimality conditions testproblem construction kuhn-tucker conditions greatest common divisor 3.15 5.39 5.49ca780508 dh february 26 1979 1:19 pm2028 4 30992521 4 30993099 4 30993099 4 30993138 4 30991313 5 30992031 5 30993099 5 30993099 5 30993099 5 3099
