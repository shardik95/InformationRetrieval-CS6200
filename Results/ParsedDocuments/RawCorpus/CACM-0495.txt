a procedure for inverting large symmetric matricesin the least squares method for simultaneousadjustment of several parameters the coefficients of the normal equations are the elements of a symmetricpositive-definite matrix in order to solve the normal equations and evaluate the precision measuresof the resulting parameters inversion of this matrix of coefficients is required many available proceduresfor matrix inversion do not take advantage of the symmetry thus when programmed for a high-speedcomputer all n^2 elements must be stored and manipulated whereas only n  1)2 of them are independent in order to allow a computer of given memory capacity to handle a larger matrix the following procedurefor inverting a symmetric matrix has been devised.cacm august 1962busing w r.levy h s.ca620833 jb march 17 1978 9:09 pm495 5 495495 5 495495 5 495
