computer education in a graduate school of managementseveral years of experience have led to the belief that the creativedesign and evaluation of management information systems requiresa thorough understanding of the related computer technology conceptssuch as paging and priority interrupt systems can best be explained at the machine language level any machine used for expositionshould fulfill several criteria it should 1 raise as fewspurious issues as possible 2 allow without undue effort thesolution of interesting problems 3 be capable of exposing alloutstanding issues of significance capable of exposing all outstandingissues of significance within the chosen machine 4 beseful for pursuing issues in great depth when appropriate 5 notbe committed to the equipment provided by any manufacturer 6 be able to provide the student with diagnostic aids to a great depth;7 allow the student ready access to the machine 8 be capableof extension to expose new issues as they come along we haveconstructed a simulated machine and its associated software whichmeets these criteria this system called the prism system,is documented by a primer and a reference manual.cacm february 1970ness d n.green r s.martin w a.moulton g a.education simulation machine language,management information systems interpreters1.52 3.51 4.13 4.21ca700209 jb february 14 1978 10:15 am2106 5 21062106 5 21062106 5 2106
