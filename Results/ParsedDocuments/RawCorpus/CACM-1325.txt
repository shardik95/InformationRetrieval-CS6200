remote on-line real-time computer diagnosisof the clinical electrocardiogrampresented in this paper is a brief report onthe hardware software system configuration and function of a system for the remote online real-time digitalcomputer diagnosis of clinical electrocardiograms it seems likely that efforts of this sort will leadto a satisfactory solution to the problem of the automatic diagnosis of electrocardiograms currentattempts by the authors to extend the diagnostic capabilities of the present system are particularly concernedwith increasing the fidelity of the adaptive matched filters the development of three dimensional pattern analysis,the analysis of parallel electrocardiographer-computer diagnostic interaction and a study of the possibilityof introducing major tree-like branching decisions early in the diagnostic process.cacm january 1965whipple g h.dickson j f.horibe h.stark l.ca650112 jb march 8 1978 2:27 pm1325 4 13251325 5 13251325 5 13251325 5 1325462 5 1325
