an operating environment for dynamic-recursivecomputer programming systemspresented in this paper is a brief nontechnicalintroduction to oedipus a computer programming system which can serve as an operating environment fordynamic and/or recursive programs and programming systems the available services include dynamic allocationof storage for contiguous blocks of arbitrary size input and output for a hierarchy of data types,a public pushdown list for automatic recursive programming a rudimentary compiler for subroutinecommunication and bookkeeping and debugging aids.cacm june 1965brown w s.ca650608 jb march 6 1978 10:18 pm1247 4 12471945 4 12471247 5 12471247 5 12471247 5 12471336 5 12471397 5 12472704 5 12471247 6 12471247 6 12471552 6 12471749 6 12472356 6 12472379 6 12472673 6 1247
