register allocation via usage countsthis paper introduces the notion of usage counts,shows how usage counts can be developed by algorithms that eliminate redundant computations anddescribes how usage counts can provide the basis for register allocation the paper compares registerallocation based on usage counts to other commonly used register allocation techniques and presents evidencewhich shows that the usage count technique is significantly better than these other techniques.cacm november 1974freiburghouse r a.optimization redundant computations common subexpressions,register allocation compilers programming languages virtual memory demand paging4.12 4.2 4.39ca741105 jb january 16 1978 10:24 am1781 4 25791807 4 25792034 4 25792290 4 25792579 4 25792579 4 25792579 4 25792923 4 25792923 4 25792945 4 25791535 5 25791807 5 25791947 5 25792579 5 25792579 5 25792579 5 2579
