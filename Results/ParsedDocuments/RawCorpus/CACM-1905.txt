the simplex method of linear programming using lu decompositionstandard computer implementations of dantzig'ssimplex method for linear programming are based upon forming the inverse of the basic matrix and updatingthe inverse after every step of the method these implementations have bad round-off error properties this paper gives the theoretical background for an implementation which is based upon the lu decomposition,computed with row interchanges of the basic matrix the implementation is slow but has goodround-off error behavior the implementation appears as cacm algorithm 350.cacm may 1969bartels r h.goulub g h.simplex method linear programming lu decomposition,round-off errors computational stability5.41ca690504 jb february 17 1978 3:49 pm1905 4 19051744 5 19051905 5 19051905 5 19051905 5 1905
