an optimal method for deletion in one-sided height-balanced treesa one-sided height-balanced tree is a binarytree in which every node's right subtree has a height which is equal to or exactly one greater than theheight of its left subtree it has an advantage over the more general avl tree in that only one bitof balancing information is required two bits are required for the acl tree it is shown that deletion ofan arbitrary node of such a tree can be accomplished in o(logn operations where n is the number of nodesin the tree moreover the method is optimal in the sense that its complexity cannot be reduced in orderof magnitude this result coupled with earlier results by hirschberg indicates that of the three basicproblems of insertion deletion and retrieval only insertion is adversely affected by this modification of an avl tree cacm june 1978zweben s.mcdonald m.balanced binary search trees3.73 3.74 4.34 5.25 5.31ca780601 dh february 26 1979 12:48 pm2839 4 30963009 4 30963042 4 30963042 4 30963065 4 30963096 4 30963096 4 30963096 4 30963163 4 30963163 4 30963163 4 30962839 5 30962889 5 30963009 5 30963065 5 30963096 5 30963096 5 30963096 5 30963163 5 30962839 6 30962839 6 30962889 6 30963009 6 30963065 6 30963096 6 30963096 6 3096
