preliminary report on a system for general space planninga computer language and a set of programs withinthat language are described which allow the formulating and solving of a class of space planningproblems the language is an extension of algol and includes means to represent spaces and objects to manipulatethem and to test the resulting arrangements according to a variety of constraints the algorithmsused to solve problems expressed in this language rely on heuristic programming both the languageand the search algorithms are detailed.cacm february 1972eastman c m.automated design architecture heuristic programs space planning3.20 3.40 3.64 3.66ca720202 jb january 31 1978 4:35 pm2389 4 23892078 5 23892389 5 23892389 5 23892389 5 2389
