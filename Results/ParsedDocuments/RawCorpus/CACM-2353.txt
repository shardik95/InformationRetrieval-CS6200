fast finite-difference solution of biharmonic problemssetting the reynolds number equal to zero ina method for solving the navier-strokes equations numerically results in a fast numerical method forbiharmonic problems the equation is treated as a system of two second order equations and a simplesmoothing process is essential for convergence an application is made to a crack-type problem.cacm may 1972greenspan d.schultz d.numerical analysis partial differential equations,biharmonic equation boundary value problem5.17ca720507 jb january 31 1978 9:43 am2352 4 23532353 4 23532094 5 23532353 5 23532353 5 23532353 5 2353
