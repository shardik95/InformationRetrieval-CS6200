reducing truncation errors by programmingin accumulating a sum such as in a numericalintegration with a large number of intervals the sum itself becomes much larger than the individualaddends this may produce a less accurate sum as the number of intervals is increased separate variablescan be established as accumulators to hold partial sums within various distinct intervals thus,the extensive successive truncations are eliminated.cacm june 1964wolfe j m.ca640615 jb march 9 1978 9:22 pm1052 5 10521052 5 10521052 5 10521328 5 10521333 5 10522144 5 10521052 6 10521052 6 10521052 6 1052
