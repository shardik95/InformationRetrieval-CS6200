on the application of the process of equalizationof maxima to obtain rational approximation to certain modified bessel functionsthe second remes algorithm as originally establishedfor polynomials may converge or not when the approximating functions are rational however thefew results known in this domain show how efficient the algorithm can be to obtain approximations with asmall error much more than in the polynomial case in which the best approximation can be very nearlyapproached directly by a series development the aim of this paper is to investigate the limitationsof the applicability of certain extensions of the algorithm to the case where the approximations are rationalas well as to present some numerical results.cacm december 1966gargantini l.ca661204 jb march 2 1978 2:39 pm1015 4 13461346 4 13461346 4 13461440 4 13461645 4 1346951 4 1346951 5 13461346 5 13461346 5 13461346 5 1346532 5 1346
