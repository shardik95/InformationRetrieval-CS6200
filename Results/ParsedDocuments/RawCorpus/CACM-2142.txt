reconstruction of pictures from their projectionsthere are situations in the natural sciencesand medicine e.g in electron microscopy and x-ray photography in which it is desirable to estimate thegray levels of a digital picture at the individual points from the sums of the gray levels along straightlines projections at a few angles usually in such situations the picture is far from determinedand the problem is to find the most representative picture three algorithms are described all usingmonte carlo methods which were designed to solve this problem the algorithms are applicable in a largeand varied number of fields the most important uses may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particlesfrom electron micrographs and three-dimensional x-ray analysis.cacm december 1971gordon,r.herman g t.approximation biomedical image processing efficientencoding image processing linear programming mathematical programming monte carlo techniques optimization,picture compression picture description picture processing stereology x-ray analysis3.12 3.13 3.15 3.17 3.63 5.41 5.6ca711201 jb february 2 1978 10:32 am2142 4 21422142 4 21422529 4 21421929 5 21422142 5 21422142 5 21422142 5 21422231 5 2142
