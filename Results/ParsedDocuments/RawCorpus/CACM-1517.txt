methods for analyzing data from computer simulation experimentsthis paper addresses itself to the problem ofanalyzing data generated by computer simulations of economic systems we first turn to a hypothetical firm,whose operation is represented by single-channel multistation queueing model the firm seeks to maximizetotal expected profit for the coming period by selecting one of five operating plans where eachplan incorporates a certain marketing strategy an allocation of productive inputs and a total cost the results of the simulated activity under each plan are subjected to an f-test two multiple comparisonmethods and a multiple ranking method we illustrate compare and evaluate these techniques the paper adopts the position that the particular technique of analysis possibly not any one of the above)chosen by the experimenter should be an expression of his experimental objective the f-test tests the homogeneityof the plans multiple comparison methods quantify their differences and multiple ranking methodsdirectly identify the one best plan or best plans.cacm november 1967naylor t h.wertz k.wonnacott t h.ca671103 jb february 26 1978 3:15 pm1517 4 15171435 5 15171517 5 15171517 5 15171517 5 1517
