the automatic integration of ordinary differential equationsan integration technique for the automaticsolution of an initial value problem for a set of ordinary differential equations is described a criterionfor the selection of the order of approximation is proposed the objective of the criterion is to increasethe step size so as to reduce solution time an option permits the solution of stiff differentialequations a program embodying the techniques discussed appears in algorithm 407.cacm march 1971gear c w.differential equations stiff equations,integration step control order control5.17ca710305 jb february 3 1978 4:28 pm2205 5 22072207 5 22072207 5 22072207 5 22072474 5 22072205 6 22072207 6 22072207 6 2207
