on coordination reduction and sentence analysisa class of coordination phenomena in naturallanguages is considered within the frame work of transformational theory to account for these phenomenait is proposed that certain machinery be added to the syntactic component of a transformationalgrammar this machinery includes certain rule schemata the conditions under which they are to beapplied and conditions determining the sequence of subtrees on which they are to be performed a solutionto the syntactic analysis problem for this class of grammars is outlined precise specificationof both the generative procedure of this paper and its inverse is given in the form of lisp function definitions.cacm april 1969petrick s r.postal p m.rosenbaum p s.natural languages generative grammar transformationaltheory syntax coordination sentence coordination sentence coordination coordination reduction,syntactic analysis grammar testing program rule testing3.42ca690406 jb february 17 1978 4:25 pm1911 5 19111911 5 19111911 5 1911
