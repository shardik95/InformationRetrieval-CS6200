a precise numerical analysis programa description is given of a program for computingthe solution to a small number of standard numerical analysis problems to any specified accuracy,up to a limit of 2000 correct decimal places each computed number is bounded in an interval with amultiple precision midpoint arithmetic operations involving these numbers are executed according to intervalarithmetic concepts with non-significant digits automatically discarded details are suppliedof problem specification and problem computation.cacm september 1974 aberth o.interval arithmetic multiple precision list structure error control4.49 5.10 5.11 5.12 5.14 5.19ca740903 jb january 17 1978 9:01 am1258 4 26051292 4 26051497 4 26051975 4 26052555 4 26052605 4 26052605 4 26051026 5 26052286 5 26052605 5 26052605 5 26052605 5 2605
