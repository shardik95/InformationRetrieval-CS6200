on the representation of symmetric polynomialsrelations are given between certain symmetricpolynomials in the light of the theory of the symmetric group such an approach unifies earlier workand lends insight to previously published work by aaron booker a generalization of graeffe's root-squaringtechnique for the determination of the roots of a polynomial is suggested.cacm july 1967mckay j k s.ca670706 jb february 28 1978 8:56 am1567 4 15671948 4 15671559 5 15671567 5 15671567 5 15671567 5 1567
