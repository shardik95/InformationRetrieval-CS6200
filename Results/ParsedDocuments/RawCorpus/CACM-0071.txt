proposal for a feasible programming systemthis paper proposes designing a programmingfacility itself involving a digital computer and a program which will assist the preparation of large-scalereal-time programs this facility is to be capable of preparing programs for any of a varietyof machines having characteristics similar to those of the facility's computer one of the basic assumptionsis that there will be enough random-access storage available to avoid the necessity for segmentinga constructed program in any fashion other than a trivial one while this assumption is somewhat unrealistic,it is intended to provide an opportunity to concentrate on the other aspects of program construction the programming system should stress the discovery in source program statements of as many errorsas possible before attempting to construct an object program among the computer characteristicswhich are advocated are a program interrupt scheme a large set of characters and indirect addressing.cacm august 1959bagley p r.ca590802 jb march 22 1978 6:16 pm71 5 7171 5 7171 5 71
