synchronization in a parallel-accessed data basethe following problem is considered givena data base which can be manipulated simultaneously by more than one process what are the rules for synchronizationwhich will maximize the amount of parallel activity allowed it is assumed that the data basecan be represented as a graph an example of such a data base is a hierarchy of directories for an on-linefile system methods for synchronization of processes are examined their validity isdiscussed and their performance compared.cacm november 1969shoshani a.bernstein a j.parallel accessing parallel search file search,data base synchronization locking deadlock3.73 3.74 4.32ca691102 jb february 15 1978 1:13 pm1805 4 18281828 4 18281828 4 18281854 4 18281854 4 18281877 4 18281960 4 18282150 4 18282187 4 18282317 4 18282319 4 18282377 4 18282342 4 18282376 4 18282379 4 18282424 4 18282482 4 18282618 4 18282632 4 18282704 4 18282723 4 18282738 4 18282740 4 18282741 4 18282867 4 18283184 4 18281748 5 18281749 5 18281828 5 18281828 5 18281828 5 1828
