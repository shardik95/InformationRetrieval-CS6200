an optimal real-time algorithm for planar convex hullsan algorithm is described for the construction in real-time of theconvex hull of a set of n points in the plane using an appropriate datastructure the algorithm constructs the convex hull by successiveupdates each taking time o(log n thereby achieving a totalprocessing time o(n log n cacm july 1979preparata f.computational geometry convex hull planar set ofpoints real-time algorithms on-line algorithms 4.49 5.25 5.32ca790702 dh august 22 1979 2:07 pm3151 4 31512997 5 31513151 5 31513151 5 31513151 5 3151
