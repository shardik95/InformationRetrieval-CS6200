on the expected lengths of sequences generatedin sorting by replacement selectingin the replacement-selecting technique of sorting,one is interested in the ratio l(j of the expected length of the j-th sequence generated by thetechnique to the number of memory cells used using complex-variable theory it is shown that l(j 2 and that asymptotically the average interval between sign changes of l(j)2 is 2.6662.cacm july 1969hooker w w.replacement selecting sorting sequence lengths,asymptotic expected length recursion relation generating function meromorphic function3.74 5.31ca690713 jb february 15 1978 6:37 pm1867 4 18672272 4 18671638 5 18671867 5 18671867 5 18671867 5 1867
