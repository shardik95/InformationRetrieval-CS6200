automatic error bounds on real zeros of rational functionsa procedure for implementing an interval arithmeticversion of the newton-raphson method is proposed the procedure require only a starting intervalover which the zeros of a given rational function are to be located the method automatically provides bounds for roundoff error.cacm november 1966dargel r h.loscalzo f r.witt t h.ca661107 jb march 2 1978 3:31 pm1351 5 13511351 5 13511351 5 1351
