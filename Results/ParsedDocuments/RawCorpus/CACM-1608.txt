numerical integration of function that has a poleit is common to need to integrate numericallyfunctions that diverge somewhere outside the range of integration even if the divergence occurs quitefar away integration formulas like simpson's that depend on fitting a polynomial usually will beinaccurate near a pole they will be very bad a method is described that gives formulas that will integratefunctions of this kind accurately if the orders and positions of the poles are known explicitformulas are given that are easy to use on an automatic computer it is shown that they can be usedfor some other singularities as well as poles if the integral converges integration can be carriedto the singularity the accuracy of the integration with a pole of second order is discussed and as an example,the new formula is compared with simpson's the new formulas are useful even far from the pole,while near the pole their advantage is overwhelming.cacm april 1967eisner e.ca670407 jb february 28 1978 11:20 am1608 5 16081608 5 16081608 5 1608
