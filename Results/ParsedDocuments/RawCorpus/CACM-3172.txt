an algorithm for planning collision-freepaths among polyhedral obstaclesthis paper describes a collision avoidance algorithmfor planning a safe path for a polyhedral object moving amongknown polyhedral objects the algorithm transforms the obstaclesso that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitraryreference point on the moving object a trajectory of thisreference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions.trajectories are found by searching a network which indicates for each vertex in the transformed obstacles which other vertices can be reached safely.cacm october 1979lozano-perez t.wesley m.path finding collision-free paths polyhedral objects,polyhedral obstacles graph searching growing objects3.15 3.64 3.66 8.1ca791005 db january 17 1980 10:13 am3172 4 31723116 5 31723172 5 31723172 5 31723172 5 3172
