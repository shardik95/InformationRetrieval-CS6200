matrix reduction-an efficient methodthe paper describes an efficient method forreduction of the binary matrices which arise in some school time-tabling problems it is a developmentof that described by john lions it has been generalized and adapted to fit into the complete timetablingprocess to use a more compact data representation and more efficient processing techniques to take fulleradvantage of possible available previous knowledge about the matrix and it is designed as a structuredprogram which can readily be coded by the reader in the high level or low level programming languageof his choice practical tests of the method have shown it to be a good basis for a realistic timetabling algorithm.cacm march 1975johnston h c.hoare c a r.binary matrices matrix reduction tight set schooltimetable construction structured programming3.51 4.9 5.39ca750301 jb january 10 1978 9:03 am1367 4 27872619 4 27872772 4 27872772 4 27872787 4 27872787 4 27871116 5 27871429 5 27872787 5 27872787 5 27872787 5 2787
