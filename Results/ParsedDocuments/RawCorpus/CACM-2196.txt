a man-machine approach toward solving the traveling salesman problemthe traveling salesman problem belongs to animportant class of scheduling and routing problems it is also a subproblem in solving others such asthe warehouse distribution problem it has been attacked by many mathematical methods with but meagersuccess only for special forms of the problem or for problems with a moderate number of points canit be solved exactly even if very large amounts of computer time are used heuristic procedures havebeen proposed and tested with only slightly better results this paper describes a computer aided heuristictechnique which uses only a modest amount of computer time in real-time to solve large 100-200)point problems this technique takes advantage of both the computer's and the human's problem-solvingabilities the computer is not asked to solve the problem in a brute force way as in many of today's heuristics,but it is asked to organize the data for the human so that the human can solve the problem easily the technique used in this paper seems to point to new directions in the field of man-machine interactionand in the field of artificial intelligence.cacm may 1971krolak p.felts w.marble g.heuristic procedures computer-aided heuristic technique,man-machine interaction artificial intelligence assignment problem mask of the assignment rubber bandtour generator interaction process traveling salesman problem3.57 3.66 5.30ca710503 jb february 3 1978 3:00 pm2196 5 21962196 5 21962196 5 2196
