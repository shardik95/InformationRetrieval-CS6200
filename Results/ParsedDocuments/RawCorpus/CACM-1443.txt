a method for finding the least squares estimateof the intersection point of two helices in spacewhen the helical trajectories of two chargedparticles moving away from a common point in a magnetic field are reconstructed from measurements onthe tracks the reconstructed tracks are perturbed by measurement and other errors and do not in general,intersect a method is given for adjusting the reconstructed tracks in a least squares manner so that they do intersect.cacm april 1966royston r j.gregory j.ca660406 jb march 3 1978 10:42 am1443 5 14431443 5 14431443 5 1443
