a program data flow analysis procedurethe global data relationships in a programcan be exposed and codified by the static analysis methods described in this paper a procedure is givenwhich determines all the definitions which canpossibly reach each node of the control flow graphof the program and all the definitions that are live on each edge of the graph the procedure usesan interval ordered edge listing data structure and handles reducible and irreducible graphs indistinguishably.cacm march 1976allen j e.cocke j.program optimization data flow analysis,flow graphs algorithms compilers4.12 5.24ca760303 jb january 5 1978 8:33 am2877 5 28772877 5 28772877 5 28773103 5 28771860 6 28772877 6 2877
