automatic error analysis for determining precisionthe problem considered is that of evaluating arational expression to within any desired tolerance on a computer which performs variable-precision floating-pointarithmetic operations an automatic error analysis technique is given for determining directlyfrom the results of a trial low-precision interval arithmetic calculation just how much precisionand data accuracy are required to achieve a desired final accuracy the technique given generalizeeasily to the evaluation of many nonrational expressions.cacm september 1972richman p l.error analysis interval arithmetic precision control5.11ca720904 jb january 27 1978 4:39 pm2286 5 22862286 5 22862286 5 22862555 5 22862605 5 22861026 6 22862286 6 22862286 6 2286
