management science a view from nonlinear programminga brief history of integer and continuousnonlinear programming is presented as well as the current obstacles to practical use of these mathematicalprogramming techniques it is forecast that the useful contributions to nonlinear programming actuallymade in the next few years are more likely to be consolidations than theoretical breakthroughs thesecontributions are likely to be the documentation of standard test problems construction of user orientedsoftware and comparisons of currently known algorithms to demonstrate which techniques are best for specific problems.cacm july 1972shanno d f.weil r l.integer programming linear programming mathematicalprogramming nonlinear programming quadratic programming management science operations research algorithms5.41 8.3ca720704 jb january 30 1978 3:14 pm2324 5 23242324 5 23242324 5 2324
