a general formulation of storage allocationformalization of a general computer storageallocation process is attempted with a given computer m is associated a fictitious computer m essentiallyidentical to m except in respect to possession of unbounded primary storage mappings of the totalstorage set internal and external of m into the direct address set of m are introduced a programsequence p for m is termed m-admissible relative to a specific execution time period if there is a mappingunderwhich p and its effective data referents are all located in the direct address set of m storageallocation is considered as a process of establishing for an arbitrary m program a sequence of mappings a decouplingof the program into m-admissible subprograms and a linking set of interludes an existence proofin terms of a completely interpretive m program as indicated some special cases are discussed variousrestrictions on generality of m programs are considered under which more practical realizationof allocation processes becomes tractable.cacm october 1961roberts jr a e.ca611003 jb march 16 1978 1:22 pm278 5 278278 5 278278 5 278
