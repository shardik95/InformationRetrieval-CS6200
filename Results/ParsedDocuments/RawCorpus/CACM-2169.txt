the altran system for rational function manipulation-a surveyaltran is a complete system for symbolic computationwith rational functions in several variables with integer coefficients it has been designed andimplemented to handle large problems with ease and efficiency considerable effort has been spent to ensurea minimum amount of machine dependence in the implementation thus permitting the system to be installedquickly and easily on a variety of computing machines in this paper a brief description of the language,run time data structures and implementation is given.cacm august 1971hall jr a d.symbolic algebra rational function manipulation,polynomial manipulation interpreters translators4.13 4.29ca710803 jb february 2 1978 4:17 pm2167 5 21692169 5 21692169 5 21692169 5 21691379 6 21691392 6 21691393 6 21692169 6 2169
