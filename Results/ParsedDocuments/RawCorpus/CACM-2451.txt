design of tree structures for efficient queryinga standard information retrieval operation isto determine which records in a data collection satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values the process of locating the desired responses can be represented by a tree search model this paperposes an optimization problem in the design of such trees to serve a well-specified application theproblem is academic in the sense that ordinarily the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practicaltechniques on the other hand it is potentially useful for the comparison it affords between observedperformance and that of an intuitively attractive ideal search procedure as a practical applicationof such a model this paper considers the design of a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representationof data and shows that essentially the same algorithm can be used to design either an idealsearch tree or a bit-vector tree an experimental study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts.cacm september 1973casey r g.tree file information storage and retrieval clustering,search data structure data management query answering3.62 3.74ca730904 jb january 23 1978 9:38 am1050 4 24511234 4 24511935 4 24511936 4 24512017 4 24512032 4 24512257 4 24512257 4 24512360 4 24512360 4 24512451 4 24512451 4 24512451 4 24512451 4 24512452 4 24512452 4 24512556 4 24512556 4 24512765 4 24512978 4 2451944 5 24511935 5 24511936 5 24512451 5 24512451 5 24512451 5 24512765 5 24512965 5 2451849 5 24511936 6 24511976 6 24512046 6 24512046 6 24512451 6 24512451 6 24512452 6 2451616 6 2451
