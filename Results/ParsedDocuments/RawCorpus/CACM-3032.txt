reverse path forwarding of broadcast packetsa broadcast packet is for delivery to allnodes of a network algorithms for accomplishing this delivery through a store-and-forward packet switching computer network include 1 transmission of separately addressed packets 2 multidestinationaddressing 3 hot potato forwarding,4 spanning tree forwarding and 5 source based forwarding tothis list of algorithms we add 6 reverse path forwarding a broadcast routing method which exploitsrouting procedures and data structures already available for packet switching reverse path forwardingis a practical algorithm for broadcast routing in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks the algorithm is described as being practical because it is not optimal according to metrics developedfor its analysis in this paper and also because it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexitythan that required for the known alternatives cacm december 1978dalal y.metcalfe r.reverse path forwarding broadcast packets routing,computer networks store-and-forward packet switching broadcast protocols3.81 4.32 5.32ca781207 dh january 18 1979 3:10 pm3032 4 30323119 4 30322849 5 30323032 5 30323032 5 30323032 5 3032
