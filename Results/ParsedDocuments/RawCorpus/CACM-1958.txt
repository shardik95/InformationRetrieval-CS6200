improving round-off in runge-kutta computations with gill's methoda runge-kutta-gill scheme in common use is based on an incompleteadaptation for floating point operations of gill's method animproved version reduces round-off error significantly in this notethe heart of the scheme is presented in fortran language it isthen shown how an improved version of the method can be obtained withthe addition of two fortran statements the two version is asignificant improvement a numerical example comparing the two is included.cacm december 1970thompson r j.runge-kutta methods ordinary differentialequations round-off error error analysis5.11 5.17ca701205 jb february 9 1978 3:40 pm1958 5 19581958 5 19581958 5 1958
