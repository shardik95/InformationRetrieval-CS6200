implementation of the substring test by hashinga technique is described for implementing thetest which determines if one string is a substring of another when there is low probability that the testwill be satisfied it is shown how the operation can be speeded up considerably if it is preceded bya test on appropriately chosen hash codes of the strings.cacm december 1971harrison m c.substring hashing subset signature informationcompression information retrieval searching3.74 5.30 5.6ca711204 jb february 2 1978 10:14 am2139 5 21392139 5 21392139 5 21392532 5 21392631 5 21392746 5 21393001 5 21391665 6 21391739 6 21392033 6 21392139 6 21392139 6 21392139 6 21392139 6 21392532 6 21392545 6 21392786 6 2139
