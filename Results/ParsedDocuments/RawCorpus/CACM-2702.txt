on the complexity of lr(k testingthe problem of determining whether an arbitrarycontext-free grammar is a member of some easily parsed subclass of grammars such as the lr(k grammarsis considered the time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixedinteger and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test in the first case it is shown that forevery k there exists an o(n(k+2 algorithm for testing the lr(k property where n is the size of thegrammar in question on the other hand if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters thenthe complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k more specifically,it is shown that this problem is np-complete when k is expressed in unary when k is expressed inbinary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time these results carry over to manyother parameterized classes of grammars such as the ll(k strong ll(k slr(k lc(k and strong lc(k grammars.cacm december 1975hunt h b iiiszymanski t g.ullman j d.computational complexity context-free grammars,parsing lr(k grammars np-complete problems4.12 5.23 5.25ca751205 jb january 5 1978 4:28 pm2702 5 27022702 5 27022702 5 2702
