segment sizes and lifetimes in algol 60 programsthe characteristics of the virtual memory requirementsof a sample of algol 60 programs have been measured distributions are presented for thesizesof memory requests and for their holding times lifetimes the results are presented in terms of johnston'scontour model and a simple abstract machine they provide new empirical evidence of certain aspectsof the construction and behavior of real programs and some of their implications for the design of virtualmemory systems are presented and discussed.cacm january 1977batson a p.brundage r e.virtual memory program behavior segmentation,storage allocation algol 60 contour model4.22 4.34 4.45 6.21ca770105 jb january 3 1978 12:05 am2095 4 30002218 4 30002218 4 30002498 4 30002596 4 30002734 4 30002734 4 30002902 4 30002911 4 30003000 4 30003000 4 30003000 4 30003067 4 30001879 5 30002095 5 30002864 5 30003000 5 30003000 5 30003000 5 3000
