thoth a portable real-time operating system thoth isa real-time operating system which is designed to be portableover a large set of machines it is currently running on two minicomputerswith quite different architectures both the system and applicationprograms which use it are written in a high-level language.because the system is implemented by the same software on differenthardware it has the same interface to user programs hence,application programs which use thoth are highly portable thothencourages structuring programs as networks of communicating processes by providing efficient interprocess communication primitives.cacm february 1979cheriton d.malcolm m.melen l.sager g.portability real time operating systems minicomputer3.80 4.30 4.35ca790206 dh april 12 1979 9:10 am2319 4 31272378 4 31272320 4 31272632 4 31272738 4 31272740 4 31272868 4 31272928 4 31273127 4 31273127 4 31272080 5 31272277 5 31273127 5 31273127 5 31273127 5 3127
