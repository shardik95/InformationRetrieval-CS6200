a theorem-proving language for experimentationbecause of the large number of strategiesand inference rules presently under consideration in automated theorem proving there is a need for developinga language especially oriented toward automated theorem proving this paper discusses some of the featuresand instructions of this language the use of this language permits easy extension of automatedtheorem-proving programs to include new strategies and/or new inference rules such extend ability willpermit general experimentation with the various alternative systems.cacm june 1974henschen l.overbeek r.wos l.theorem proving resolution factoring,paramodulation programming languages3.60 4.22 5.21ca740602 jb january 17 1978 3:37 pm2644 5 26442644 5 26442644 5 2644
