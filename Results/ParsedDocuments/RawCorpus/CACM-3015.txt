relaxation methods for image reconstructionthe problem of recovering an image a functionof two variables from experimentally available integrals of its grayness over thin strips is of greatimportance in a large number of scientific areas an important version of the problem in medicine isthat of obtaining the exact density distribution within the human body from x-ray projectionsne approachthat has been taken to solve this problem consists of translating the available information intoa system of linear inequalities the size and the sparsity of the resulting system typically 25,000inequalities with fewer than 1 percent of the coefficients nonzero makes methods using successiverelaxations computationally attractive as compared to other ways of solving systems of inequalities in this paper it is shown that for a consistent system of linear inequalities any sequence of relaxarion parameterslying strictly between 0 and 2 generates a sequence of vectors which converges to a solution under the same assumptions for a system of linear equations the relaxation method converges to the minimumnorm solution previously proposed techniquesare shown to be special cases of our procedure withdifferent choices of relaxation parameters the practical consequences for image reconstruction of thechoice of the relaxation parameters are discussed.cacm february 1978herman g.lent a.lutz p.biomedical image processing image reconstruction,x-ray tomography mathematical programming linear inequalities relaxation techniques3.12 3.17 3.34 3.63 5.14 5.18 5.41ca780208 jb march 28 1978 2:13 pm3015 5 30153015 5 30153015 5 3015
