an executive system implemented as a finite-state automatonthe 473l command and control system used bythe air force permits many operators to access large data files through the use of a computer the man-machineinterface is satisfied by several communication consoles from which operators may enter queries andview replies a data link permits remote stations to send messages status reports and inventories directlyto the computer the information received over the on-line data link is used to update the data fileswhich are stored on disk the 473l programming system is divided into an executive control program andfive components with different processing priorities these priorities permit the system to be most sensitiveto the console inputs and permit the operators at all the consoles to time share the central processor the executive control program provides for the orderly transitions of control among the programmingsystem components the major emphasis of the paper is on the technique of using the definition of afinite-state automaton for organizing the executive control program.cacm november 1964heistand r e.ca641111 jb march 9 1978 3:56 pm1471 4 9721774 4 9722911 4 972560 4 972972 4 972972 4 972972 4 972972 5 972972 5 972972 5 972271 5 972273 5 972276 5 972
