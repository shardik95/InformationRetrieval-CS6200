the expanding world of computersthe onward sweep of automatic processing ofinformation is impeded by nine principal barriers geography cost problem complexity man-machine communication,inadequate sensors lack of understanding distance time and size the main incentive for breachingthese barriers is the universal need for processing information ever more urgent as the greaterpart of human work activity changes from production to service computer developments in hardware programming,time-sharing education data communication and displays are judged by how effectively they remove thesebarriers and their barrier-smashing potentialities indicate continued rapid expansion problem-orientedlanguages are particularly effective over the entire front online computers and time-sharing also rate highby this measure education and increased understanding are basic to all progress with the computer this complexbut powerful tool is the most important one available to governments and scientists to use in studyingthe problems being created by the population explosion and in analyzing possible solutions.cacm april 1968harder e l.barriers philosophy developments computer-aided design,problem-oriented languages data communication education computer science forecast survey introduction1.0 1.3 2.1 3.24 4.0 6.20 6.30ca680401 jb february 23 1978 11:36 am1769 5 17691769 5 17691769 5 1769
