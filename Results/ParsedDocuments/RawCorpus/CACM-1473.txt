the stability of the fourth order runge-kuttamethod for the solution of systems of differential equationsthe problem of the region of stability of thefourth order-runge-kutta method for the solution of systems of differential equations is studied thisregion can be characterized by means of linear transformation but can not be given in a closed form in the paper this region is determined by the electronic digital computer z22.cacm february 1966karim a i a.ca660211 jb march 3 1978 2:31 pm1473 5 14731473 5 14731473 5 1473
