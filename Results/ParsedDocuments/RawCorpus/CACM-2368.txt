an implemented graph algorithm for winning shannon switching gamesin this tutorial paper a computer programwhich wins shannon switching games is described since these games are played on graphs the programis a good example of the implementation of graph algorithms the two players in a shannon switching game,connect and cut have nonsimilar goals either connect cut or the player moving first is guaranteedthe existence of a winning strategy the simple strategy explained in this paper is valid in all threecases in fact the major routines never need to know whether the computer is connect or cut.cacm april 1972chase s m.graph algorithms graph processing shannon switchinggames game playing graph theory positional games demonstration programs game theory spinning trees3.69 5.32ca720405 jb january 31 1978 1:34 pm2368 5 23682368 5 23682368 5 2368
