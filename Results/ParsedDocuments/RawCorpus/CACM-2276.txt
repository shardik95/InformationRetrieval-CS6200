computer methods for sampling fromthe exponential and normal distributionsvarious methods are known for transforming uniformlydistributed random numbers into exponentiallyand normally distributed quantities the most efficientones are compared in terms of memory requirements and speed with some new algorithms a number of proceduresconvert taylor series expansions directly into sampling steps an approach which may be used forsampling from any continuous distribution for the exponential distribution a definite recommendationcan be made whereas in the case of the normal distribution there remains a choice between slower andshorter algorithms and faster but space consuming methods.cacm october 1972ahrens j h.dieter u.random numbers pseudorandom normal distribution,exponential distribution exponential distribution simulation numerical analysis3.29 3.57 5.11 5.5ca721002 jb january 27 1978 3:55 pm1073 4 22762137 4 22762276 4 22762276 4 22761073 5 22761153 5 22762276 5 22762276 5 22762276 5 22762565 5 22761716 6 22762276 6 2276
