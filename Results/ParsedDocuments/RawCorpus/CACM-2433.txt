control structures in illiac iv fortranas part of an effort to design and implementa fortran compiler on the illiac iv an extended fortran called ivtran has been developed this languageprovides a means of expressing data and control structures suitable for exploiting illiac iv parallelism this paper reviews the hardware characteristics of the illiac and singles out unconventional featureswhich could be expected to influence language and compiler design the implications of these features fordata layout and algorithm structure are discussed and the conclusion is drawn that data allocation rather thancode structuring is the crucial illiac optimization problem a satisfactory method of data allocation isthen presented language structures to utilize this storage method and express parallel algorithms are described.cacm october 1973millstein r e.array processing parallelism detection explicitparallelism array allocation parallel control structures illiac iv fortran4.12 4.21 4.22ca731007 jb january 20 1978 11:30 am2433 5 24332433 5 24332433 5 24332785 5 24332433 6 24332685 6 2433
