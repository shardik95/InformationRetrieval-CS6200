logic-structure tableslogic tables are an excellent way of developingand expressing the logic required in procedures operations systems and circuits a set of rules forwriting and using logic tables is explained by means of some simple examples then the logic structureof a vending machine is given in which two logic tables are used logic tables are two-dimensional innature enabling us to fully express and consider both the sequential and parallel aspects of logic theycan be compiled directly into a computer program and so eliminate the need for flow charting and hand coding.cacm june 1961cantrell h n.king j.king f e h.ca610605 jb march 16 1978 10:40 pm1237 5 320250 5 320320 5 320320 5 320320 5 320250 6 320320 6 320320 6 320753 6 320
