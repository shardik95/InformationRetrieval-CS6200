symbol manipulation in fortran-sasp i subroutinesa set of subroutines for use in fortran aredescribed whose purpose is to synthesize output strings from i input strings which have been analyzedby the shadow general syntactic analysis subroutine reported earlier and/or ii packed bcd strings formedin any way function-type subroutines are included for intermediate manipulations which are performedon the strings which are stored in an abbreviated internal representation the automatic way in whichan internal representation for each newly created substring is stored sequentially in a block of commonstorage and the manner in which a storage block is dynamically allocated for that purpose are discussed.cacm june 1964bailey m j.barnett m p.burleson p b.ca640605 jb march 9 1978 9:43 pm1051 4 10621062 4 10621062 4 10621121 4 10621139 4 10621265 4 10621781 4 1062720 4 1062759 4 10621062 5 10621062 5 10621062 5 10621211 5 10622902 5 1062464 5 1062794 5 10621051 6 10621051 6 10621062 6 10621062 6 10621184 6 10621211 6 10621552 6 10621879 6 10622435 6 10622596 6 10622734 6 10622747 6 10622768 6 1062
