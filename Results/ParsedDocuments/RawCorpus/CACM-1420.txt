a new uniform pseudorandom number generatora new multiplicative congruential pseudorandomnumber generator is discussed in which the modulus is the largest prime within accumulator capacityand the multiplier is a primitive root of that prime this generator passes the usual statisticaltests and in addition the least significant bits appear to be as random as the most significant bits-aproperty which generators having modulus 2^k do not possess.cacm june 1966hutchinson d w.ca660602 jb march 3 1978 9:01 am1420 5 14201420 5 14201420 5 14201691 5 14201293 6 14201420 6 14201631 6 1420
