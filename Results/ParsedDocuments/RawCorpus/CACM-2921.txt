regular right part grammars and their parsersthis paper in troduces an alternative to context-freegrammars called regular right part rrp grammars which resemble pascal syntax diagrams formally,rrp grammars have production right parts which are nondeterministic finite state machines fsms)and as a special case regular expressions since these can be converted to fsms rrp grammarsdescribe the syntax of programming languages more concisely and more understandably than is possible withcf grammars also in troduced is a class of parsers rrp lr(m k parsers which includes the cf lr(k parsersand provides the same advantages informally an rrp lr(m k parser can determine the right end ofeach handle by considering at most k symbols to the right of the handle and the left end after theright end has been found by considering at most m symbols to the left of the handle a mechanism fordetermining the left end is required because there is no bound on the length of the handle.cacm october 1977lalonde w r.finite state machines automata regular expressions,syntax diagrams,lr(k grammars parser construction parsing programming languages language generation,formal definition compilers translators scanners4.2 5.21 5.23ca771005 jb december 27 1977 11:01 am1989 4 29212060 4 29212179 4 29212581 4 29212698 4 29212739 4 29212795 4 29212921 4 29212921 4 29213087 4 29213154 4 29211989 5 29212110 5 29212921 5 29212921 5 29212921 5 2921
