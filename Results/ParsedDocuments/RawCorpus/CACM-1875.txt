polynomial and spline approximation by quadratic programmingthe problem of approximation to a given function,or of fitting a given set of data where the approximating function is required to have certainof its derivations of specified sign over the whole range of approximation is studied two approachesare presented in each of which quadratic programming is used to provide both the constraints on the derivativesand the selection of the function which yields the best fit the first is a modified bernstein polynomialscheme and the second is a spline fit.cacm july 1969amos d e.slater m l.constant sign derivatives bernstein polynomials,linear concavity constraints quadratic programming splines5.13 5.41ca690705 jb february 17 1978 9:22 am1875 5 18751875 5 18751875 5 1875
