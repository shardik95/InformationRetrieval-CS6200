fen-an axiomatic basis for program semanticsa formal system is presented which abstractsthe notions of data item function and relation it is argued that the system is more suitable than settheory or its derivatives for the concise and accurate description of program semantics it is shownhow the system can be used to build composite data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing,structuring and uniting it is also demonstrated that completely new primitive types can be introducedinto languages through the mechanism of singleton data types both deterministic and nondeterministicfunctions are shown to be definable in the system it is described how the local environment can be modeledas a data item and how imperative statements can be considered functions on the environment thenature of recursive functions is briefly discussed and a technique is presented by which they can be introducedinto the system the technique is contrasted with the use of the paradoxical combinator y thequestions of local and global environments and of various modes of function calling and parameter passingare touched upon the theory is applied to the proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semanticsof the assignment conditional and iterative statements an appendix is included which presents indetail the formal system governing webs and fen the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper.cacm august 1973maclennan b j.semantics formal systems lambda-calculus extensiblelanguages data types modes axioms correctness formal language definition formal description data structures,description languages models of computation4.22 5.21 5.24 5.26ca730804 jb january 23 1978 11:01 am1469 4 24701486 4 24701491 4 24701781 4 24702021 4 24702060 4 24702178 4 24702222 4 24702227 4 24702294 4 24702315 4 24702326 4 24702326 4 24702470 4 24702470 4 24702470 4 24702470 4 24702684 4 24702732 4 24702865 4 24702896 4 24702943 4 24703014 4 24703044 4 24703068 4 24703077 4 24703124 4 24703143 4 24701303 5 24701469 5 24701834 5 24702264 5 24702470 5 24702470 5 24702470 5 2470
