the cray-1 computer systemthis paper describes the cray-1 discussesthe evolution of its architecture and gives an account of some of the problems that were overcome duringits manufacture the cray-1 is the only computer to have been built to date that satisfies erda's classvi requirement a computer capable of processing from 20 to 60 million floating point operations persecond 1 the cray-1's fortran compiler cft is designed to give the scientific user immediate accessto the benefits of the cray-1's vector processing architecture an optimizing compiler cft vectorizes"innermost do loops compatible with the ansi 1966 fortran standard and with many commonly supportedfortran extensions cft does not require any source program modifications or the use of additional nonstandardfortran statements to achieve vectorization thus the user's investment of hundreds of man monthsof effort to develop fortran programs for other contemporary computers is protected.cacm january 1978russell r.architecture computer systems1.2 6.2 6.3ca780106 jb march 28 1978 5:24 pm3024 5 30243024 5 30243024 5 3024
