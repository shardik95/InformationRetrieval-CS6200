a simscript-fortran case studytwo programs for a vehicle dispatching model,one written in 7040 simscript and the other in 7040 fortran iv are compared the comparison is madein terms of basic program design decisions storage requirements computer time used and the ease of makingchanges in the simscript program the primary design considerations center around the choice of modelvariables model changing events and model testing in the fortran program basic design problems relateto the representation of the passage of time the allocation of storage and the organization of inputdata the comparison of these differently designed programs shows that the simscript program uses more computerstorage and more computer time but requires fewer program changes to introduce model revisions.cacm december 1967weinert a e.ca671205 jb february 26 1978 2:30 pm1503 4 15031781 4 15031860 4 15032091 4 15031366 5 15031503 5 15031503 5 15031503 5 1503
