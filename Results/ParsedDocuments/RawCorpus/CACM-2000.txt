a variation of the goodman-lance method forthe solution of two-point boundary value problemsa recently published method for the interpolativesolution of nonlinear equations is improved,and applied to give a significant variation of the goodman-lancemethod for the solution of two-point boundary value problems the resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solutionof optimal control problems in the euler-lagrange formulation.quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variationis nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context.cacm september 1970kimble g w.goodman-lance boundary-value problems,newton's method nonlinear equations,optimal control optimization ordinary differential equations,secant method interpolative solution orthogonal matrices3.21 5.15 5.17ca700905 jb february 10 1978 1:39 pm2000 5 20002000 5 20002000 5 2000
