three criteria for designing computing systems to facilitate debuggingthe designer of a computing system should adoptexplicit criteria for accepting or rejecting proposed system features three possible criteria of thiskind are input recordability input specifiability and asynchronous reproducibility of output these criteriaimply that a user can if he desires either know or control all the influences affecting the contentand extent of his computer's output to define the scope of the criteria the notion of an abstractmachine of a programming language and the notion of a virtual computer are explained examples of applicationsof the criteria concern the reading of a time-of-day clock the synchronization of parallelprocesses protection in multiprogrammed systems and the assignment of capability indexes.cacm may 1968van horn e c.computer design computer design criteria computersystems computer systems design input equipment input equipment design operating systems operatingsystems design multiprogramming multiprogrammed systems multiprogrammed system design virtual computers,programming languages programming language design program semantics programming language semantics,determinism reproducibility repeatability deterministic computers protection memory protection,information security information privacy computing reliability debugging program debugging program testing,parallel processing parallel programming multiprocessing2.11 4.12 4.13 4.20 4.30 4.42 4.43 5.24 6.20 6.35ca680509 jb february 23 1978 9:06 am1458 4 17471523 4 17471603 4 17471698 4 17471747 4 17471748 4 17471854 4 17471877 4 17471960 4 17472377 4 17472378 4 17472497 4 17472558 4 17472625 4 17472632 4 17472840 4 17472941 4 17473105 4 17473144 4 17471471 5 17471747 5 17471747 5 17471747 5 17472151 5 17471653 6 17471747 6 17471860 6 1747
