storing a sparse tablethe problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in computer science the standard technique for storing such tables ishashing but hashing has poor worst-case performance we proposea good worst-case method for storing a static table of n entries,each an integer between 0 and n  1 the method requires 0(n wwords of storage and allows o(logn n access time although our methodis a little complicated to use in practice our analysis showswhy a simpler algorithm used for compressing lr parsing tables works so well.cacm november 1979tarjan r.yao a.gaussian elimination parsing searching,sparse matrix table compression table lookup3.74 4.12 4.34 5.25ca791104 db january 23 1980 11:24 am3041 4 31763126 4 31763176 4 31762905 5 31763176 5 31763176 5 31763176 5 3176
