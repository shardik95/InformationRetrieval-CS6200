a programming system for the on-line analysis of biomedical imagesa preliminary description of the software for a computer-displaysystem is given with special emphasis on the man-machine interaction this system is intended for a wide variety of biomedical applications.as an example the methods are applied to the karyotyping of chromosomes the system is separated into four programming tasks picture transformations file maintenance picture structuring and display management picture structuringis considered as the vehicle for man-machine communication.a prototype data format for pictures called a picture-form is developed.structure operators are defined which manipulate picture-forms to produce new pictures-forms many of the ideas are taken from the symbolic mathematical laboratory at mit conceived by marvin minsky.cacm may 1970hodes l.image processing biomedical image processing on-line image processing,semiautomatic image processing data structure structure operators,picture processing biomedical picture processing on-line pictureprocessing semiautomatic picture processing semiautomatickaryotyping karyotyping list processing picture processing3.12 3.34 3.63 4.39 6.29ca700501 jb february 13 1978 2:27 pm2065 5 20652065 5 20652065 5 2065
