computer synthesis of holograms for 3-d displayoptical and digital holography are reviewed the mathematical model and computational techniques of the authors digital holographic process are discussed,and applications of computer holography are suggested computer holograms have been made of three-dimensionalobjects which give faithful reconstructions even in white light a new approach based on pointapertures for the image is discussed photographs of the images reconstructed from digital holograms are presented.cacm october 1968lesem l b.hirsch p m.holography optics fourier transforms computerapplications display device photography physics mathematics image processing3.17 3.19 5.19ca681001 jb february 21 1978 4:27 pm1686 5 16861686 5 16861686 5 16862004 5 16861686 6 16861915 6 1686
