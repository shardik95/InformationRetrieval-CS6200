efficient implementation of a variable projectionalgorithm for nonlinear least squares problemsnonlinear least squares frequently arise for whichthe variables to be solved for can be separated into a linear and a nonlinear part a variable projectionalgorithm has been developed recently which is designed to take advantage of the structure of a problemwhose variables separate in this way this paper gives a slightly more efficient and slightly moregeneral version of this algorithm than has appeared earlier.cacm march 1974krogh f t.nonlinear least squares parameter estimation variable projection5.14 5.15ca740313 jb january 18 1978 10:49 am2670 5 26702670 5 26702670 5 2670
