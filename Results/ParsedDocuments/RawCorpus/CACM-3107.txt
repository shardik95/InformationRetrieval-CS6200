generating beta variates with nonintegrel shape parametersa new rejection method is described for generatingbeta variates the method is compared with previously published methods both theoretically and throughcomputer timings it is suggested that the method has advantages in both speed and programmingsimplicity over previous methods especially for difficult combinations of parameter values.cacm april 1978cheng r.beta variates random numbers simulation5.5 8.1ca780409 dh february 26 1979 3:32 pm2847 4 31072928 4 31073046 4 31073098 4 31073107 4 31072569 5 31073107 5 31073107 5 31073107 5 3107
