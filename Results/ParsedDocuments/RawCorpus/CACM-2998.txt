an empirical study of list structure in lispstatic measurements of the list structure offive large lisp programs are reported and analyzed in this paper these measurements reveal substantialregularity or predictability among poin ters to atoms and especially among poin ters to lists pointersto atoms are found to obey roughly zipf's law which governs word frequencies in natural languages poin tersto lists usually poin t to a location physically nearby in memory the use of such regularities in thespace-efficient representation of list structure is discussed linearization of lists whereby successivecdrs or cars are placed in consecutive memory locations whenever possible greatly strengthens theobserved regularity of list structure it is shown that under some reasonable assumptions the entropy orinformation content of a car-cdr pair in the programs measured is about 10 to 15 bits before linearization,and about 7 to 12 bits after.cacm february 1977clark d w.green c c.list structure measurement lisp list structureregularity poin ter compression zipf's law list linearization poin ter entropy3.69 4.29 4.34 4.6 5.6ca770202 jb december 30 1977 2:55 am2855 5 29982944 5 29982998 5 29982998 5 29982998 5 29983106 5 29981549 6 29981549 6 29981826 6 2998210 6 2998210 6 29981972 6 29981972 6 29982513 6 29982665 6 29982766 6 29982766 6 29982833 6 29982833 6 29982855 6 29982954 6 29982998 6 29982998 6 29982998 6 2998
