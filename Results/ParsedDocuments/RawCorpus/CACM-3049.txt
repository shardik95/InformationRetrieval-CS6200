a simply extended and modified batchenvironment graphical system sembegs)sembegs is a complete batch environment graphicalsystem containing components for handling graphical data files for displaying the contents ofthese files on a variety of graphical hardware and for performing graphical batch input operations sembegs is easy to extend and modify to meet the growing needs of a large batch environment and is evenextendable to a fully interactive system the paper presents the conceptual view of graphics leadingto the design of sembegs and outlines the major components of the system the design of sembegs is foundedupon the basic assumption that the true aim of computer graphics is to describe graphical entities,rather than as commonly held to provide graphical input and output functional capabilities sembegsis built around a basic graphical data management system bagdams which provides a common means of communicatingthe descriptions of graphical entities between the various components of sembegs bagdamsprovides facilities for storing retrieving and manipulating the descriptions of graphical entitiesprovided by and received by application programs,graphics packages and graphical devices cacm november 1978wendorf j.computer graphics data structures graphic display,graphic input graphical database device independent graphics4.33 4.34 8.2ca781102 dh january 26 1979 1:30 pm3030 4 30493031 4 30493049 4 30493049 4 30493049 4 30493049 4 30492956 5 30492957 5 30492958 5 30492960 5 30493049 5 30493049 5 30493049 5 3049
