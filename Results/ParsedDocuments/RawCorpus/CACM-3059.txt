models for parallel processing within programs:application to cpu:i/o and i/o:i/o overlapapproximate queueing models for internal parallelprocessing by individual programs in a multiprogrammed system are developed in this paper the solution techniqueis developed by network decomposition the models are formulated in terms of cpu:i/o and i/o:i/o overlapand applied to the analysis of these problems the percentage performance improvement from cpu:i/ooverlap is found to be greatest for systems which are in approximate cpu:i/o utilization balance and forlow degrees of multiprogramming the percentage improvement from i/o:i/o overlap is found to be greatestfor systemtems in which the i/o system is more utilized than the cpu.cacm october 1978towsley d.chandy k.browne j.multiprogramming parallel processing queueingnetwork models multiprocessing of computation and i/o 4.32 8.1ca781002 dh january 29 1979 6:23 pm3059 4 30593070 4 30591685 5 30592988 5 30593059 5 30593059 5 30593059 5 30593059 6 3059
