a scheduling philosophy for multiprocessing systemsa collection of basic ideas is presented whichhave been evolved by various workers over the past four years to provide a suitable framework for thedesign and analysis of multiprocessing systems the notions of process and state vector are discussed,and the nature of basic operations on processes is considered some of the connections between processesand protection are analyzed a very general approach to priority-oriented scheduling is described,and its relationship to conventional interrupt systems is explained some aspects of time-orientedscheduling are considered the implementation of the scheduling mechanism is analyzed in detail and thefeasibility of embodying it in hardware established finally several methods for interlocking the executionof independent processes are presented and compared.cacm may 1968lampson b w.time-sharing multiprocessing process scheduling,interlocks protection priority interrupt systems4.31 4.32 6.21ca680508 jb february 23 1978 9:13 am1458 4 17481523 4 17481603 4 17481698 4 17481747 4 17481748 4 17481854 4 17481877 4 17481960 4 17482377 4 17482378 4 17482497 4 17482558 4 17482625 4 17482632 4 17482840 4 17482941 4 17483105 4 17483144 4 17481471 5 17481748 5 17481748 5 17481748 5 17481805 5 17481828 5 17481854 5 17482187 5 17481421 6 17481471 6 17481518 6 17481572 6 17481748 6 17481748 6 17481748 6 17481748 6 17481749 6 17481749 6 17481781 6 1748
