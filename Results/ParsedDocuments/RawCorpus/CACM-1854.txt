on multiprogramming machine coding and computer organizationthe author feels that the interrupt featurewhich is available in most modern computers is a potent source of programming pitfalls and errors andthat it therefore may heavily contribute to the unreliability of programs making use of it a programmingscheme is presented which avoids the concept of the interrupt and permits the specification of concurrent(or pseudoconcurrent activities in a supposedly more perspicuous manner it is intended to serve asa basis for the construction of operating systems which are prime examples of programs with concurrentactivities the scheme includes a set of basic instructions for the generation termination and synchronizationof parallel processes a set of routines representing these instructions and thereby simulating ahypothetical machine organization has been implemented and test on the ibm system/360 two programs using theseinstructions written in pl360 are presented cacm september 1969wirth n.multiprogramming parallelism interrupt input-output,computer organization file handling pl3604.21 4.22 4.32 4.41 6.21ca690901 jb february 15 1978 5:14 pm1380 4 18541458 4 18541523 4 18541552 4 18541603 4 18541693 4 18541698 4 18541747 4 18541748 4 18541781 4 18541805 4 18541828 4 18541828 4 18541854 4 18541854 4 18541854 4 18541854 4 18541860 4 18541877 4 18541877 4 18541960 4 18541960 4 18542060 4 18542150 4 18542187 4 18542317 4 18542319 4 18542377 4 18542377 4 18542378 4 18542342 4 18542376 4 18542379 4 18542424 4 18542482 4 18542497 4 18542558 4 18542618 4 18542625 4 18542632 4 18542632 4 18542704 4 18542723 4 18542738 4 18542740 4 18542741 4 18542840 4 18542867 4 18542941 4 1854557 4 18543105 4 18543144 4 18543184 4 18541421 5 18541471 5 18541748 5 18541749 5 18541854 5 18541854 5 18541854 5 18541960 5 18541471 6 18541749 6 18541854 6 1854
