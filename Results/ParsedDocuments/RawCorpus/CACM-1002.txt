a rapid method for digital filteringsince much of the computer time spent in time-seriesanalysis is used for multiplications a minimum multiplication method was devised for digitalfiltering with the expectation that it would be useful in the on line real-time analysis of biologicaldata the filters are constructed from a succession of readily analyzable components in a manner that facilitatescascading the repertoire of frequency response curves includes relatively good low-pass andband-pass designs programs are available for implementing both the synthesis of these filters andtheir application on computers whose assemblers allow the definition of recursive macros.cacm september 1964whittlesey j r b.ca640909 jb march 9 1978 5:03 pm1002 5 10021002 5 10021002 5 1002
