considerations in the design of a multiplecomputer system with extended core storagethe use of large quantities of addressable(but not executable fast random access memory to heighten the multiprogramming performance of a multicomputer systemis discussed the general design of the hardware arrangement and the software componentsand functions of such a system are based on a planned configuration of dual cdc 6600's that share onemillion words of extended core storage in the generalization of such a design special emphasis isplaced on estimating expected gains when compared with the traditional configuration of separate and independentcomputers without extended core storage an observation is made on the use of conventional slowerspeed random access storage devices in place of the faster memory.cacm may 1968fuchel k.heller s.multiple computer systems extended core storage,multiprogrammed operating systems multiprocessor operating systems control data corporation 6600 operating system with ecs4.30 4.32ca680506 jb february 23 1978 9:27 am1750 5 17501750 5 17501750 5 17502988 5 17501750 6 1750
