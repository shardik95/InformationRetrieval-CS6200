trace-driven modeling and analysis ofcpu scheduling in multiprogramming systemmicroscopic level job stream data obtained ina production environment by an event-driven software probe is used to drive a model of a multiprogrammingcomputer system the cpu scheduling algorithm of the model is systematically varied this technique,called trace-driven modeling provides an accurate replica of a production environment for the testing of variationsin the system at the same time alterations in scheduling methods can be easily carried out in acontrolled way with cause and effects relationships being isolated the scheduling methods tested includedthe best possible and worst possible methods the traditional methods of multiprogramming theory round-robin,first-come-first-served etc and dynamic predictors the relative and absolute performances ofthese scheduling methods are given it is concluded that a successful cpu scheduling method must be preemptiveand must prevent a given job from holding the cpu for too long a period.cacm december 1972sherman s.baskett iii f.browne j c.scheduling cpu scheduling,multiprogramming,performance measurement trace driven models4.10 4.20 4.31 4.32ca721210 jb january 27 1978 10:57 am2245 5 22452245 5 22452245 5 22452571 5 22453072 5 22453119 5 22451713 6 22452219 6 22452245 6 22452245 6 22452245 6 22452375 6 22452798 6 22452849 6 22452859 6 2245
