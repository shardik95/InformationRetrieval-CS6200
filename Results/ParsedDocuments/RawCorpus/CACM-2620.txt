execution time requirements for encipherment programsalthough encipherment has often been discussedas a means to protect computer data its costs are not well established five experiments were conductedto measure the cpu time on a cdc 6400 required by additive ciphers programmed both in assembly languageand in fortran a null transformation to measure the time to move data without encipherment enciphermentwith one-word key encipherment with a 125-word key double key encipherment and encipherment usinga pseudo random key the results were analyzed for consistency over 100 runs and the effects of constantand intermittent errors were considered timing rates for assembly language encipherment rangedfrom 498,800 characters per second for a pseudo random key cipher to 2,092,000 characters per secondfor a constant one-word key cipher the latter is almost equivalent to the rate required simply to movedata without encipherment fortran tests required over four times as much cpu time this paper introducesthe idea on enciphering time coefficient the ratio of enciphering time to the time taken tofetch and store data without encipherment.cacm august 1974friedman t d.offman l j.encipherment ciphers security privacy transformations,protection cryptography cryptology2.12 2.43 3.70 3.81 4.32 4.39ca740804 jb january 17 1978 10:05 am2620 5 26202620 5 26202620 5 2620
