an interactive software system for computers-aideddesign an application to circuit projectthe characteristics of an interactive software system intended to constitute an interface between designer and computer during various steps ofthe design process are presented the main emphasis is given to thedescription of the features of the two high level user orientedlanguages operating at different levels on which the interactionis based the first one is imol an interactive monitor language,which is designed to perform the overall and control functionsof the software system its design criteria provide the user withcommands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform allthe functions needed in computer-aided circuit design the second one is coif a circuit oriented graphic language which is designedto describe generate and manipulate graphic problem specifications it is an extension of fortran with graphic-type variables,so that the designer who is familiar with fortran need not learn a new language the application to computer-aided circuit designis in particular examined on the other hand the adopted designcriteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages to different computer-assisted applications.cacm september 1970bracchi g.somalvico m.interaction graphics computer graphics computer-aided design circuitdesign software system software organization language,monitor language graphic language extended fortran3.24 3.25 4.13 4.22 4.3ca700902 jb february 10 1978 2:20 pm1853 4 20032003 4 20032003 4 20032003 4 20032002 4 20032152 4 20031710 5 20031767 5 20032003 5 20032003 5 20032003 5 20032105 5 20032230 5 20032003 6 2003
