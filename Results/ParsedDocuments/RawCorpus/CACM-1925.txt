concepts of use in contour map processinggeneralized techniques whose use can simplifythe solution of problems relating to contour maps one of these techniques makes use of the topologicalproperties of contour maps the topology is represented by a graphical structure in which adjacentcontour lines appear as connected nodes another generalized technique consists of utilizing geometricalproperties to determine the characteristics of straight lines drawn on the contour map both of thesetechniques have been applied to the problem of locating the ground track of an aircraft fromelevation readings obtained during a flight.cacm march 1969morse s p.map contour map contour lines topological properties,geometrical properties graph of contour map navigation3.1ca690302 jb february 20 1978 9:41 am1925 5 19251925 5 19251925 5 19252287 5 19252547 5 19253062 5 19251326 6 19251871 6 19251925 6 19251925 6 19251925 6 1925
