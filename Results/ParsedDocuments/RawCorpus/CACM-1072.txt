an improved equivalence algorithman algorithm for assigning storage on the basisof equivalence dimension and common declarations is presented the algorithm is based on a tree structure,and has reduced computation time by 40 percent over a previously published algorithm by identifying allequivalence classes with one scan of the equivalence declarations the method is applicable in any problemin which it is necessary to identify equivalence classes given the element pairs defining the equivalence relation.cacm may 1964galler b a.fisher m j.ca640517 jb march 9 1978 11:48 pm1072 4 10721781 4 10721072 5 10721072 5 10721072 5 10721646 5 1072316 5 1072830 6 1072987 6 10721072 6 10721179 6 10721647 6 1072680 6 1072
