analysis of boolean program models for time-shared paged environmentsdirected graphs or their associated matrices arefrequently used to represent the logical structure of sequences of computer instructions such techniquesare used and in addition data references are represented in a nondirected model the complete structuralspecification of a program is represented by a combined model a transformation of the combinedmodel yields a new model in which additional timing information is also contained analysis of these modelsprior to execution yields information valuable in determining segmentation of instructions and data fora time-shared environment as well as for initial page loading during execution the analysis may beused for look ahead control of page turning.cacm april 1969lowe t c.time-sharing paging segmentation executive,compiler monitor program model4.39 6.21ca690401 jb february 17 1978 4:50 pm1916 4 19161916 4 19161533 5 19161916 5 19161916 5 19161916 5 19162130 5 1916666 5 19161916 6 1916
