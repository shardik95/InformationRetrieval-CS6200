directed random generation of sentencesthe problem of producing sentences of a transformationalgrammar by using a random generator to create phrase structure trees for input to the lexicalinsertion and transformational phases is discussed a purely random generator will produce base treeswhich will be blocked by the transformations and which are frequently too long to be of practical interest a solution is offered in the form of a computer program which allows the user to constrain and directthe generation by the simple but powerful device of restricted subtrees the program is a directedrandom generator which accepts as input a subtree with restrictions and produces around it a tree whichsatisfies the restrictions and is ready for the next phase of the grammar the underlying linguisticmodel is that at noam chomsky as presented in aspects of the theory of syntax the program is writtenin fortran iv for the ibm 360/67 and is partof a unified computer system for transformational grammar it is currently being used with several partial grammars of english.cacm january 1969friedman j.transformational grammar natural language syntax languageprocessing sentence generation computational linguistics syntax3.42ca690110 jb february 20 1978 11:44 am1030 4 19391261 4 19391886 4 19391939 4 19391939 4 19391030 5 19391939 5 19391939 5 19391939 5 19392767 5 19393064 5 1939678 5 19391846 6 19391939 6 19391939 6 19392742 6 19392767 6 19392936 6 1939
