sp/k a system for teaching computer programmingsp/k is a compatible subset of the pl/i languagethat has been designed for teaching programming the features of the sp/k language were chosen to encouragestructured problem solving by computers to make the language easy to learn and use to eliminateconfusing and redundant constructs and to make the language easy to compile the resulting languageis suitable for in troducing programming concepts used in various applications including business dataprocessing scientific calculations and non-numeric computation sp/k is actually a sequence of languagesubsets called sp/1 sp/2,p/8 each subset in troduces new programming language constructs whileretaining all the constructs of preceding subsets each subset is precisely defined and can be learnedor implemented without the following subsets.cacm may 1977holt r c.wortman d b.barnard d t.cordy j r.programmer education universities community colleges,high schools pl/i sp/k minicomputers programming language design teaching programming in troductory computing1.5 4.2 4.12 4.13ca770501 jb december 29 1977 4:40 am2708 4 29712820 4 29712971 4 29712971 4 29712971 4 29713045 4 29711835 5 29711974 5 29712534 5 29712971 5 29712971 5 29712971 5 2971
