approximation of polygonal maps by cellular mapsthe approximation of polygonal thematic maps by cellularmaps an important operation in geographical data processing,is analyzed the data organization used for representing the polygonalmaps is a widely used segment-based data structure where classlabels identify the regions bordering each segment on either side.the approximation algorithm presented operates on such anorganization eliminating the need for the recognition of region boundaries.each segment is examined only once the versatility ofthe new organization is further illustrated by the outline of algorithmsfor area computation and point inclusion the algorithm isapplied to a set of soil maps converted to computer-readableform by means of a coordinate digitizer.cacm september 1979nagy g.wagle s.polygon maps cellularization gridding geographic data structures,computational geometry computer cartography automated cartography3.14 4.34 8.2ca790906 db january 14 1980 12:04 pm1630 4 31652547 4 31652987 4 31653165 4 31653165 4 31651326 5 31652987 5 31653165 5 31653165 5 31653165 5 3165
