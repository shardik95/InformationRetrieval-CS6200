multidimensional binary search trees used for associative searchingthis paper develops the multidimensional binarysearch tree or k-d tree where k is the dimensionality of the search space as a data structure for storage ofinformation to be retrieved by associative searches the k-d tree is defined and examples are given itis shown to be quite in its storage requirements a significant advantage of this structure is that a singledata structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently various utility algorithms are developed;their proven average running times in an n record file are insertion o log n deletion ofthe root o n^k-1)k deletion of a random node o log n and optimization guarantees logarithmic performanceof searches o n log n search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified[proven maximum running time of o n^k-t)k and for nearest neighbor queries empirically observed averagerunning time of o log n these performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms forthese tasks an algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query the main focus of thispaper theoretical it is felt however that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications,and examples of potential uses are given.cacm september 1975bently j l.associative retrieval binary search trees key,attribute information retrieval system nearest neighbor queries partial match queries intersectionqueries binary tree insertion3.63 3.70 3.74 4.49ca750902 jb january 6 1978 3:22 pm2722 5 27222722 5 27222722 5 2722
