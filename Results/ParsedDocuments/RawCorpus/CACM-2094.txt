on an algorithm for nonlinear minimax approximationcertain nonlinear minimax approximation problems are characterized by properties which permit the application of special algorithms,mainly based on the exchange algorithms of remes 1934 1935 fortheir solution in this paper the application to problems of thistype of a general nonlinear algorithm due to osborne and watson(1969 is considered examples are given to illustrate that thisalgorithm can give satisfactory results and in particular cansuccessfully solve problems which lead to difficultieswith the more conventional specialist method.cacm march 1970watson g a.minimax approximation nonlinear approximation linear programming5.13 5.41ca700304 jb february 13 1978 4:52 pm1932 4 20942094 4 20941566 5 20942094 5 20942094 5 20942094 5 20942352 5 20942353 5 20942094 6 20942094 6 2094
