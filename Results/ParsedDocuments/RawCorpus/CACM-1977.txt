an interactive display for approximation by linear programmingan interactive programwith a graphical display has been developed for the approximation ofdata by means of a linear combination of functions includingsplines selected by the user the coefficients of the approximationare determined by linear programming so as to minimize the errorin either the l1 or l-infinity norm auxiliary conditions such asmonotonicity or convexity of the approximation can also be imposed thisinteractive system is described and several examples of its use are given.cacm november 1970lafata p.rosen j b.approximation data fitting functional approximation linearprogramming interactive graphical display spline functions5.13 5.41ca701101 jb february 10 1978 9:06 am1977 5 19771977 5 19771977 5 19772604 5 19771977 6 1977
