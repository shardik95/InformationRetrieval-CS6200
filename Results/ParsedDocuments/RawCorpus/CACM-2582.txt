improving locality by critical working setsa new approach to program locality improvementvia restructuring is described the method is particularly suited to those systems where primary memoryis managed according to a working set strategy it is based on the concept of critical working set aworking set which does not contain the next memory reference the data the method operates upon are extracted froma trace of the program to be restructured it is shown that except in some special cases themethod is not optimum however the experimental results obtained by using the method to restructure aninteractive text editor and the file system module of an operating system have shown its substantial superiorityover the other methods proposed in the literature.cacm november 1974ferrari d.program restructuring program segmentation localityimprovement memory hierarchies virtual memory multiprogramming restructuring techniques staticrestructuring dynamic restructuring working set strategy critical working set4.32 4.39 4.43 4.49 4.9ca741102 jb january 16 1978 10:50 am1892 4 25821901 4 25822085 4 25822095 4 25822218 4 25822277 4 25822319 4 25822319 4 25822329 4 25822358 4 25822365 4 25822373 4 25822380 4 25822434 4 25822499 4 25822501 4 25822582 4 25822582 4 25822582 4 25822582 4 25822669 4 25822669 4 25822828 4 25822863 4 25822881 4 25822928 4 25822996 4 25823006 4 25823054 4 25823067 4 25823152 4 25821751 5 25821924 5 25822017 5 25822130 5 25822582 5 25822582 5 25822582 5 2582
