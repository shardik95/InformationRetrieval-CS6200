breaking substitution ciphers using a relaxation algorithmsubstitution ciphers are codes in which each letterof the alphabet has one fixed substitute and the word divisions do not change in this paper the problem of breaking substitutionciphers is represented as a probabilistic labeling problem.every code letter is assigned probabilities of representing plain textletters these probabilities are updated in parallel for allcode letters using joint letter probabilities iterating the updatingscheme results in improved estimates that finally lead tobreaking the cipher the method is applies successfully to two examples.cacm november 1979peleg s.rosenfeld a.cryptography substitution ciphers,probabilistic classification relaxation3.42 3.63ca791103 db january 23 1980 11:15 am3175 5 31753175 5 31753175 5 3175
