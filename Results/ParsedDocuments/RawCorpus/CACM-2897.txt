a case study of a new code generation technique for compilersrecent developments in optimizing techniqueshave allowed a new design for compilers to emerge such a compiler translates the parsed source code intolower level code by a sequence of steps each step expands higher level statements into blocks oflower level code and then performs optimizations on the result each statement has only one possibleexpansion-the task of tailoring this code to take advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations this paper provides evidence that this strategy can indeed result in good object code thetraditionally difficult pl/i concatenate statement was investigated as a detailed example a set of fairlysimple optimizations was identified which allow the compiler to produce good code more elaborate optimizationscan further improve the object code for most contexts of the concatenate statement the codeproduced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization strategy described above compares favorably with thecode produced by a conventional pl/i optimizing compiler.cacm december 1977carter j l.compiler structure optimizing compiler codegeneration pl/i compiler concatenation program optimization optimization techniques data flow analysis4.12 4.13 4.22ca771203 jb february 1 1980 3:54 am2897 5 28972897 5 28972897 5 2897
