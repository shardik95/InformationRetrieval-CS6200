relative effects of central processor and input-outputspeeds upon throughput on the large computerpresented in this paper is a technique fordetermining the relative effects of the internal speed of the computer and the speed of the input-outputunits upon the overall speed of the system equations are derived which permit the determination of theseeffects from hardware usage measurements.cacm december 1964white p.ca641208 jb march 9 1978 3:34 pm963 5 963963 5 963963 5 9631653 5 963963 6 9631069 6 9631417 6 963
