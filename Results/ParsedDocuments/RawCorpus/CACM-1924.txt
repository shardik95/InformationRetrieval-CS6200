organizing matrices and matrix operations for paged memory systemsmatrix representations and operations are examinedfor the purpose of minimizing the page faulting occurring in a paged memory system it is shown thatcarefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to enormous savings in the number of page faults occurringwhen only a small part of the total matrix can be in main memory at one time examination of addition,multiplication and inversion algorithms shows that a partitioned matrix representation i.e one submatrixor partition per page in most cases induced fewer page faults than a row-by-row representation the number of page-pulls required by these matrix manipulation algorithms is also studied as a functionof the number of pages of main memory available to the algorithm.cacm march 1969mckellar a c.coffman jr e g.matrix algorithms array processing paging algorithms,paged memory systems virtual memory systems array storage allocation storage allocation4.12 4.39 5.14ca690303 jb february 20 1978 9:35 am1892 4 19241924 4 19242095 4 19242218 4 19242297 4 19242374 4 19242526 4 19242667 4 19242668 4 19242862 4 19242863 4 19241728 5 19241924 5 19241924 5 19241924 5 19242365 5 19242582 5 19243152 5 1924987 6 19241751 6 19241754 6 19241924 6 19241924 6 19241924 6 19242017 6 19242130 6 19242362 6 19242365 6 1924
