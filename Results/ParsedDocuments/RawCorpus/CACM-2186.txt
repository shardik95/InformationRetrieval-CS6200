numerical properties of the ritz-trefftz algorithm for optimal controlin this paper the ritz-trefftz algorithm is appliedto the computer solution of the state regulator problem the algorithm represents a modification ofthe ritz direct method and is designed to improve the speed of solution and the storage requirements tothe point where real-time implementation becomes feasible the modification is shown to be more stablecomputationally than the traditional ritz approach the first concern of the paper is to describe thealgorithm and establish its properties as a valid and useful numerical technique in particular such usefulproperties as definiteness and reasonableness of condition are established for the method the secondpart of the paper is devoted to a comparison of the new techniques with the standard procedure ofnumerically integrating a matrix riccati equation to determine a feedback matrix the new technique isshown to be significantly faster for comparable accuracy.cacm june 1971bosarge jr w e.johnson o g.splines regulator problem control theory numerical analysis5.1ca710604 jb february 3 1978 10:12 am2186 5 21862186 5 21862186 5 2186
