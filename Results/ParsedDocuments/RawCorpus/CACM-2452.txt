evaluation and selection of file organization-a model and systemthis work first discusses the factors thataffect file data base organization performance an elusive subject and then presents a methodology amodel and a programmed system to estimate primarily total storage costs and average access time of severalfile organizations given a specific data base query characterization and device-related specifications based on these estimates an appropriate file structure may be selected for the specific situation the system is a convenient tool to study file structures and to facilitate as much as possible the processof data base structure design and evaluation.cacm september 1973cardenas a f.file organization file structures file management,file organization performance file organization model file structure design secondary index organization,simulation data base access time storage requirement data base analysis data management3.70 3.71 3.72 3.74 3.79 4.0ca730903 jb january 23 1978 9:46 am1050 4 24521935 4 24521936 4 24522017 4 24522032 4 24522140 4 24522257 4 24522257 4 24522360 4 24522360 4 24522451 4 24522451 4 24522452 4 24522452 4 24522452 4 24522452 4 24522556 4 24522765 4 24522765 4 24522882 4 24522901 4 24523134 4 24521936 5 24521976 5 24522198 5 24522452 5 24522452 5 24522452 5 24522765 5 24522882 5 2452849 5 24521936 6 24521976 6 24522046 6 24522198 6 24522451 6 24522452 6 24522452 6 2452616 6 2452627 6 2452
