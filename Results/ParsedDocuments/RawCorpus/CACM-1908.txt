time-sharing and batch-processing an experimentalcomparison of their values in a problem  solving situationan experimental comparison of problem-solvingusing time-sharing and batch-processing computer systems conducted at mit is described in this paper this study is the first known attempt to evaluate two such systems for what may well be the predominant userpopulation within the next decade-the professionals who as nonprogrammers are using the computer as anaid in decision-making and problem-solving rather than as a programming end in itself statisticallyand logically significant results indicate equal cost for usage of the two computer systems however,a much higher level of performance is attained by time-sharing users there are indications that significantlylower costs would have resulted if the time-sharing users had stopped work when they reacheda performance level equal to that of the batch users the users speed of problem-solving and theirattitudes made time-sharing the more favorable system.cacm may 1969gold m m.time-sharing vs batch-processing user performance,man/machine communications cost effectiveness on-line vs off-line performance decision-making performance,user/programmer behavior programming experimental empirical studies problem-solving research in man/machinecommunications man/machine symbiosis2.11 2.40 3.36 3.51 3.80ca690501 jb february 17 1978 4:10 pm1792 4 19081908 4 19081908 4 19081550 5 19081605 5 19081908 5 19081908 5 19081908 5 19082705 5 19082984 5 19081908 6 19081908 6 19083185 6 1908
