automatic segmentation of cyclic program structuresbased on connectivity and processor timingtime-shared multiprogrammed and overlayed batch systems frequentlyrequire segmentation of computer programs into discrete portions these program portions are transferred between executable andperipheral storage whenever necessary segmentation of programs in a manner that reduces the frequency of such transfers is thesubject of this paper segmentation techniques proposed by c v.ramamoorthy are subject to limitations that arise when the preferredsegment size is not compatible with the physical restrictionsimposed by the available computing equipment a generalization oframamoorthy's suggestions is made in order to allow their application when circumstances are other than ideal.cacm january 1970lowe t c.automatic segmentation cyclic program structures loops paging multiprogramming loaders assemblers compilers time-sharing program connectivity4.19 5.24 5.32ca700101 jb february 14 1978 2:20 pm2130 4 21301916 5 21302130 5 21302130 5 21302130 5 21302582 5 21301751 6 21301924 6 21302017 6 21302130 6 2130
