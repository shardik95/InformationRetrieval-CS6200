nebula a digital computer using a 20 mc glass delay line memoryoregon state university has designed and constructeda medium-speed serial digital computer using glass delay lines circulating at 22 mc as memory the design objectives as originally conceived in a special seminar were 1 to be a research projectin computer design 2 to be usable as an educational machine;and 3 to have easily modifiable hardware forbasic research in computer systems design an unusual arrangement of information within the 22 mcmemory allows a simple interface with the 340 kc arithmetic unit which results in an effective zero latencytime and provides possibilities for an associative memory the arithmetic unit has a command structure similarto large parallel machines and uses flip-flop arithmetic and control registers throughout all hardwaredevelopment has been aimed toward the concept of easy modification elaborate console controls foreffective man-machine interaction and low cost.cacm july 1966boles j a.rux p t.weingarten jr f w.ca660705 jb march 2 1978 9:35 pm1409 4 14091208 5 14091409 5 14091409 5 14091409 5 1409
