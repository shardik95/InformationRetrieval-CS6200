flow diagrams turing machines andlanguages with only two formation rulesin the first part of the paper flow diagramsare introduced to represent inter al mappings of a set into itself although not every diagram isdecomposable into a finite number of given base diagrams this becomes true at a semantical level dueto a suitable extension of the given set and of the basic mappings defined in it two normalizationmethods of flow diagrams are given the first has three base diagrams the second only two in the secondpart of the paper the second method is applied to the theory of turing machines with every turingmachine provided with a two-way half-tape there is associated a similar machine doing essentiallythe same job but working on a tape obtained from the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares the new machine belongs to the family elsewhere introduced generated by composition and iteration fromthe two machines l and r that family is a proper subfamily of the whole family of turing machines.cacm may 1966bohm c.jacopini g.ca660512 jb march 3 1978 9:35 am1425 4 14251781 4 1425438 4 1425762 4 1425249 5 14251425 5 14251425 5 14251425 5 14252709 5 14252802 5 14253004 5 14251425 6 14251425 6 14251425 6 14252138 6 14252204 6 14252247 6 14252356 6 14252456 6 14252456 6 14252477 6 14253186 6 1425
