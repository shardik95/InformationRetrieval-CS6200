a model for a multifunctional teaching systema teaching system model that was incorporatedinto an operating system of a large computer is described the model transferred control to theoperating system to execute functions other than teaching and then recovered control in order to resumeteaching the teaching system abac-ii was written to run under the operating system ibsys forthe ibm 7044 graphic system because the teaching system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself,a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray display terminal could switch readily between studentmode and programmer mode during the latter the full resources of the operating system language processors,compilers library and user's programs were at his disposal he could for example write assemble,debug and execute at the terminal a program written in any language processed by the operating system a course could therefore include text material interleaved with programming problems which the studentcould solve without leaving the terminal exercises in simulation and gaming could also be provided theimplications of a teaching system with this degree of flexibility for industrial and executive trainingas well as academic education are discussed in addition the advantages of this type of system for computerprogramming and operation are also considered.cacm june 1967engvold k j.hughes j l.ca670601 jb february 28 1978 10:24 am1591 5 15911591 5 15911591 5 15911680 5 15911591 6 1591
