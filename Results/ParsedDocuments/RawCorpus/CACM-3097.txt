optimal shift strategy for a block-transfer ccd memoryfor the purposes of this paper a block-transferccd memory is composed of serial shift registers whose shift rate can vary but which have a definite minimumshift rate the refresh rate and a definite maximum shift rate the bits iin the shift registersare numbered 0 to n  1 and blocks of n bits are always transferred always starting at bit 0 whatis the best shift strategy so that a block transfer request occurring at a random time will have to wait theminimal amount of time before bit 0 can be reached the minimum shift rate requirement does not allow oneto simply park at bit 0 and wait for a transfer request the optimal strategy involves shifting as slowlyas possible until bit 0 is passed then shifting as quickly as possible until a critical boundary isreached shortly before bit 0 comes around again this is called the hurry up and wait strategy and is wellknown outside the computer field the block-transfer ccd memory can also be viewed as a paging drumwith a variable bounded rotation speed.cacm may,1978sites r.paging drum charge coupled devices shift registermemory memory hierarchy electronic drum latency3.72 5.39 6.34 6.35ca780510 dh february 26 1979 1:05 pm2628 4 30973097 4 30972496 5 30973097 5 30973097 5 30973097 5 3097
