an algorithm for generating permutationsan algorithm is described which under repeatedapplication generates all permutations of k elements only the previously generated permutation,the constant k and a temporary index are needed starting with a particular ordering of k elements abcd)repeated application of the algorithm will generate k-1 additional permutations by k-1 successiverotations from the initial circular ordering of k objects another circular ordering can be obtainedby rotating the k-1 lowest elements for each new k-1 circular ordering another k-2 can be obtainedby rotating the k-2 lowest elements by continuing in this manner applications of the algorithm will generateall k-1 circular orderings or since each circular ordering yields k permutations thealgorithm generates all k permutations.cacm may 1967langdon jr g g.ca670508 jb february 28 197810:35 am1594 5 15941594 5 15941594 5 15942087 5 15942189 5 15943188 5 15941594 6 15941594 6 15941594 6 15942087 6 15943191 6 1594521 6 1594612 6 1594
