brad the brookhaven raster displaya multiconsole computer display system hasbeen designed that provides very rich displays at low unit cost each brad brookhaven raster display)console can plot tens of thousands of points or up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second afteran initial display system investment of 50,000 each display with teletype costs less than 3,000 the technique employed is that of programmatically generating a binary image of the desired display in acomputer the image is written on a rotating drum memory independent read heads continuously displaythe picture which is generated by swept horizontal lines a standard tv monitor serves as the display device the technique has two drawbacks a computer must compute any image to be displayed also the pointing"interaction is more difficult this is because the pointing function gives only the coordinatesof the point on the screen the inverse of the map generation process is required to calculatethe coordinates of the point on the screen the inverse of the map generation process is required tocalculate the coordinates at the selected point in the input space.cacm june 1968ophir d.rankowitz s.shepherd b j.spinrad r j.computer display computer graphics computer rasterdisplay tv display console digital tv display swept raster computer display swept raster tv computerdisplay tv graphics terminal multiconsole computer graphics inexpensive graphic terminal2.0 4.49 6.35ca680604 jb february 22 1978 4:35 pm1741 5 17411741 5 17411741 5 17411891 5 17412211 5 17412421 5 17412674 5 17412687 5 17411554 6 17411741 6 17411741 6 17411741 6 17411741 6 17411741 6 17411915 6 17412004 6 17412004 6 17412211 6 17412421 6 17412687 6 1741
