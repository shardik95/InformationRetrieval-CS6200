a note on linear programming algorithm design a combinatorial problemas linear programming models grow bigger andbigger in size much actual data that must be memorized is often put on magnetic tape or disk andconsequently there is an improportionality fast rise in the consumption of computer timeo cut downthis expense an ever increasing effort is made to design more efficient algorithms this paper ismeant to support the effort it is attempted to find some characteristics of the way a pivot columnis found the number of repetitions of a certain transfer of data from tape to core memory is considered after some simplification the problem is restated in a general way the generating function of the probabilitydistribution and the moment generating function of the number of repetitions is found asymptoticformulas are given for the moments using a result from a paper of s narumi 1 the resultsmay be applied to write very efficient routines that search for an extreme value in a table formulasprovide a means of calculating the computer timings in this case.cacm may 1966roes p b m.ca660504 jb march 3 1978 10:10 am1433 5 14331433 5 14331433 5 1433
