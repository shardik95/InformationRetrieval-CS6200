secure communications over insecure channelsaccording to traditional conceptions of cryptographicsecurity it is necessary to transmit a key by secret means before encrypted messages canbe sent securely this paper shows that it is possible to select a key over open communications channelsin such a fashion that communications security can be maintained a method is described which forcesany enemy to expend an amount of work which increases as the square of the work required of the two communicantsto select the key the method provides a logically new kind of protection against the passiveeaves dropper it suggests that further research on this topic will be highly rewarding bothin a theoretical and a practical sense.cacm april 1978merkle r.security cryptography cryptology communicationssecurity wiretap computer network security passive eavesdropping key distribution public key cryptosystem3.56 3.81ca780405 dh february 26 1979 4:18 pm3038 4 31113111 4 31113177 4 31113021 5 31113111 5 31113111 5 31113111 5 31113158 5 31112436 6 31113038 6 31113111 6 31113111 6 3111
