extending the information theory approach to convertinglimited-entry decision tables to computer programsthis paper modifies an earlier algorithm forconverting decision tables into flowcharts which minimize subsequent execution time when compiled intoa computer program the algorithms considered in this paper perform limited search and accordingly,do not necessarily result in globally optimal solutions however the greater search effort neededto obtain a globally optimal solution for complex decision tables is usually not justified by sufficientsavings in execution time there is an analogy between the problem of converting decision tables intoefficient flowcharts and the well-understood problem in information theory of noiseless coding the resultsof the noiseless coding literature are used to explore the limitations of algorithms used to solvethe decision table problem the analogy between the two problems is also used to develop improvementsto the information algorithm in extending the depth of search under certain conditions and in proposingadditional conditions to be added to the decision table finally the information algorithm is comparedwith an algorithm proposed in a recent paper by verhelst.cacm september 1974shwayder k.coding decision tables flowcharting informationtheory noiseless channel sorting3.50 5.31ca740910 jb january 17 1978 8:40 am1354 4 25982053 4 25982220 4 25982220 4 25982273 4 25982273 4 25982453 4 25982453 4 25982492 4 25982518 4 25982598 4 25982598 4 25982598 4 25982598 4 25982598 4 25982598 4 25982616 4 25982691 4 25982726 4 25982726 4 25982726 4 25982726 4 25982856 4 25982856 4 25982856 4 25983113 4 25983113 4 25981172 5 25981548 5 25982220 5 25982263 5 25982453 5 25982598 5 25982598 5 25982598 5 25982691 5 25982845 5 25982856 5 25983113 5 25981172 6 25981184 6 25981327 6 25981354 6 25981354 6 25982053 6 25982220 6 25982263 6 25982435 6 25982453 6 25982598 6 25982598 6 25982598 6 25982691 6 25982736 6 25982747 6 25982768 6 25982856 6 2598
