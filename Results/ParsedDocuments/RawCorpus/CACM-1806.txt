on the downhill methodthe downhill method is a numerical method forsolving complex equations f(z  0 on which the only restriction is that the function w  f(z mustbe analytical an introduction to this method is given and a critical review of relating literature ispresented although in theory the method always converges it is shown that a fundamental dilemma existswhich may cause a breakdown in practical applications to avoid this difficulty and to improve the rate ofconvergence toward a root some modifications of the original method are proposed and a program fortran)based on the modified method is given in algorithm 365 some numerical examples are included.cacm december 1969bach h.downhill method complex relaxation method complexiteration complex equation transcendental complex equation algebraic complex equation5.15ca691206 jb february 15 1978 2:54 pm1806 4 18061806 5 18061806 5 18061806 5 18061803 5 1806535 5 18061806 6 1806
