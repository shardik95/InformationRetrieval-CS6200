a general-purpose display processing and tutorial systemadept a display-expedited processing and tutorial)system is described this system was designed to improve man-computer communications by employinga display unit to interleave tutoring with other computer operations such as simulation programming andinformation retrieval it is written in fortran iv g for the ibm system/360 model 40 and the ibm 2250display unit under operating system/360 adept is a cataloged program that controls the standard operatingsystem by terminating and rescheduling itself automatically relinquishing computer resources allocatedto it and surrendering control to the operating system to perform other jobs it expands the powerand flexibility of computer-assisted instruction by making immediately available to students teachers,and other users the full resources system-cataloged programs of the operating system language processorsand compilers simulation models mathematical solution techniques stored data and all other library anduser programs can be incorporated into instructional material without reprogramming illustrations of the variousapplications are presented and their implications are discussed.cacm october 1968engvold k j.hughes j l.computer-assisted instruction tutorial systems,programming simulation modeling information retrieval operating systems graphics displays man-machineinterface on-line computing graphic programming1.5 3.3 3.5 3.8 4.0 4.3ca681007 jb february 21 1978 3:36 pm1680 4 16801591 5 16801680 5 16801680 5 16801680 5 1680
