elimination of special functions from differential equationsa set of ordinary differential equations whichcontains mathematical functions requiring the use of subroutines for numerical solution by electroniccomputer tabular data for numerical solution by hand calculation or function generators when analogmethods are applied can sometimes be expanded to an equivalent set of equations which do not containthe functions this is practical if these functions satisfy sufficiently simple differential equations thus among those functions which can be eliminated by this procedure are the trigonometric inverse trigonometric,exponential and many other transcendental functions.cacm march 1959powers j e.ca590301 jb march 22 1978 8:08 pm95 5 9595 5 9595 5 95
