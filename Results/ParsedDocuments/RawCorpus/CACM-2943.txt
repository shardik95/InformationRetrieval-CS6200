lucid a nonprocedural language with iterationlucid is a formal system in which programscan be written and proofs of programs carried out the proofs are particularly easy to follow and straightforwardto produce because the statements in a lucid program are simply axioms from which the proofproceeds by almost conventional logical reasoning with the help of a few axioms and rules of inferencefor the special lucid functions as a programming language lucid is unconventional because among otherthings the order of statements is irrelevant and assignment statements are equations nevertheless,lucid programs need not look much different than iterative programs in a conventional structured programminglanguage using assignment and conditional statements and loops.cacm july 1977ashcrof e a.wadge w w.program proving formal systems semantics,iteration structured programming5.21 5.24ca770709 jb december 28 1977 8:30 am2021 4 29432222 4 29432227 4 29432315 4 29432326 4 29432470 4 29432732 4 29432865 4 29432896 4 29432943 4 29433014 4 29433068 4 29433077 4 29433143 4 29431834 5 29432943 5 29432943 5 29432943 5 29433150 5 29432060 6 29432704 6 29432842 6 29432939 6 29432940 6 29432941 6 29432943 6 29433073 6 29433148 6 2943
