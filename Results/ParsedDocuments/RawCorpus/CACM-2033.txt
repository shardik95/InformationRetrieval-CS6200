space/time trade-offs in hash coding with allowable errorsin this paper trade-offs among certain computational factorsa given set of messages two new hash-coding methods are examinedand compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method.the computational factors considered are the size of the hash area(space the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set reject time and an allowable error frequency the new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods the reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications in particular applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core residenthash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods in such applications it is envisaged that overall performancecould be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area inconjunction with the new methods and when necessary by using somesecondary and perhaps time-consuming test to catch the smallfraction of errors associated with new methods an example is discussedwhich illustrates possible areas of application for the newmethods analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowinga small number of test messages to be falsely identified asmembers of the given set will permit a much smaller hasharea to be used without increasing reject time.cacm july 1970bloom b h.hash coding hash addressing scatter storage searching storagelayout retrieval trade-offs retrieval efficiency storage efficiency3.73 3.74 3.79ca700704 jb february 13 1978 9:18 am1676 4 20331682 4 20331728 4 20331860 4 20331860 4 20331973 4 20331973 4 20331992 4 20332018 4 20332018 4 20332032 4 20332033 4 20332033 4 20332033 4 20332107 4 20332107 4 20332109 4 20332109 4 20332203 4 20332203 4 20332251 4 20332251 4 20332359 4 20332524 4 20332543 4 20332543 4 20332552 4 20332559 4 20332573 4 20332770 4 20332991 4 20333053 4 20331314 5 20331785 5 20331786 5 20332033 5 20332033 5 20332033 5 20333001 5 20332033 6 20332139 6 2033
