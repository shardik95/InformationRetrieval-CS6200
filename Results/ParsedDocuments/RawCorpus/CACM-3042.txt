power treesthe new class of pk trees is presented whereheight balance is maintained for the nodes iying on particular paths the number of nodes of a pk treeasymptotically grows as a power of the height in the worst case a procedure for node insertion is given,and the class of trees considered is restricted to ipk trees which are buildable by such a procedure the average behavior of such trees studied by an extensive set of simulation runs is close to thatof avl trees in particular the family of ipo trees whose main advantage is the reduced number ofrestructurings required after node insertion is analyzed.cacm november 1978luccio f.pagli l.binary search trees pk trees ipk trees searchlength node insertion subtree rotation3.73 3.74 4.34 5.25 5.31ca781109 dh january 25 1979 4:29 pm2839 4 30422889 4 30422968 4 30423009 4 30423042 4 30423042 4 30423042 4 30423042 4 30423065 4 30423096 4 30423096 4 30423163 4 30423163 4 30422455 5 30422839 5 30422889 5 30422968 5 30423042 5 30423042 5 30423042 5 3042
