automated algebraic manipulation in celestial mechanicsin this paper we consider some of the applicationsof automated algebraic manipulation which have been made in celestial mechanics particular attentionis paid to the use of poisson series and a typical problem in perturbation theory is described the requirements of processors for use in celestial mechanics are considered and compared with those for generalmanipulation packages some future directions for research using these systems are briefly outlined to illustrate the relative simplicity of the algorithm required in celestial mechanics a typicalintegration problem is considered in an appendix cacm august 1971jefferys w h.series manipulation automated algebra celestial mechanics5.10 5.13 5.17ca710806 jb february 2 1978 3:31 pm2166 5 21662166 5 21662166 5 21662170 5 21662165 6 21662167 6 21662166 6 2166
