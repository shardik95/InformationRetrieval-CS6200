further analysis of a computing center environmentempirical distributions of program lengths,execution times processing times and loading times of over 10,000 jobs serviced in a university computingcenter environment are presented the data are subdivided according to certain characteristics of usersand jobs to obtain selected empirical conditional distributions of those time properties as well as statisticalmeasures of other interesting properties the results are interpreted in terms of the properties of the system studied.cacm may 1967walter e s.wallace v l.ca670502 jb february 28 1978 11:02 am1533 4 16041604 4 16041604 4 16041951 4 16042373 4 16041224 5 16041410 5 16041533 5 16041604 5 16041604 5 16041604 5 16041951 5 16042667 5 16042668 5 16041224 6 16041410 6 16041604 6 16041604 6 16041604 6 16041604 6 16041728 6 16041728 6 16041761 6 16041827 6 16041827 6 16042677 6 1604
