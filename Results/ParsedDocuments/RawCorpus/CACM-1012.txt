formal parsing systemsautomatic syntactic analysis has recently becomeimportant for both natural language data processing and syntax-directed compilers a formal parsing systemg  v,u,t,r consists of two finite disjoint vocabularies v and t a many-many map u from v ontot and a recursive set r of strings in t called syntactic sentence classes every program for automaticsyntactic analysis determines a formal parsing system a directed production analyzer i,t,x,p is anondeterministic pushdown-store machine with internal vocabulary i input vocabulary t and all productionsof p in the form z,a  ay1  ym where z yi are elements of the set i and a is an element of theset t every context-free language can be analyzed by a directed production analyzer the kuno-oettingermultiple-path syntactic analyzer for english is a concrete example of a directed production analyzerand of a working parsing algorithm the connection between structures assigned by the analyzer and those ofa conventional phrase structure grammar is examined in this paper.cacm august 1964greibach s a.ca640818 jb march 9 1978 6:30 pm1012 5 10121012 5 10121012 5 10121225 5 10121350 5 10121945 5 1012823 6 1012914 6 1012915 6 1012917 6 1012984 6 1012989 6 1012990 6 10121012 6 10121012 6 10121012 6 10121084 6 10121098 6 10121122 6 10121138 6 10121139 6 10121141 6 10121200 6 10121223 6 10121225 6 10121265 6 10121265 6 10121336 6 10121396 6 10121399 6 10121455 6 10121477 6 10121487 6 10121491 6 10121496 6 1012483 6 1012584 6 1012669 6 1012680 6 1012680 6 1012680 6 1012763 6 1012
