logic and semantic networksan extended form of semantic network is defined which canbe regarded as a syntactic variant of the clausal form of logic.by virtue of its relationship with logic the extendedsemantic network is provided with a precise semantics,inference rules and a procedural interpretation onthe other hand by regarding semantic networks as an abstract data structure for the representation of clauses we provide atheorem-prover with a potentially useful indexing scheme and path-followingstrategy for guiding the search for a proof.cacm march 1979deliyanni a.kowalski r.logic semantic networks theorem-proving indexing resolution deduction logic programming3.42 3.64 5.21ca790304 dh april 12 1979 3:53 pm3133 4 31333133 5 31333133 5 31333133 5 31333154 5 31332046 6 31332110 6 31333133 6 3133
