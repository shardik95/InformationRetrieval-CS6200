an algorithm for hidden line eliminationthe algorithm presented causes the elimination ofhidden lines in the representation of a perspective view of concave and convex plane-faced objects on thepicture plane all the edges of the objects are considered sequentially and all planes which hide everypoint of an edge are found the computing time increases roughly as the square of the number of edges the algorithm takes advantage of a reduced number of concave points and automatically recognizes if onlyone object with no concave points is considered in this last case the result is obtained in a much simpler way.cacm april 1969galimberti r.montanari u.hidden line elimination back line recognition three-dimensionalrepresentation plane-faced objects perspective view machine rendering of solids automaticdrawing displaying techniques computer graphics man/machine interaction man/machine communication computer-aided design4.40 4.41 4.49ca690402 jb february 17 1978 4:44 pm1915 5 19151915 5 19151915 5 19152004 5 19152687 5 19152692 5 19151686 6 19151741 6 19151915 6 19151915 6 19151915 6 19152004 6 1915
