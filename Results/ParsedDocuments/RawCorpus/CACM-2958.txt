abstract data types and the development of data structuresabstract data types can play a significant rolein the development of software that is reliable efficient and flexible this paper presents and discussesthe application of an algebraic technique for the specification of abstract data types amongthe examples presented is a top-down development of a symbol table for a block structured language a discussionof the proof of its correctness is given the paper also contains a brief discussion of the problemsinvolved in constructing algebraic specifications that are both consistent and complete.cacm june 1977guttag j.abstract data type correctness proof data type,data structure specification software specification4.34 5.24ca770605 jb december 29 1977 1:17 am2704 4 29582738 4 29582866 4 29582869 4 29582941 4 29582958 4 29583004 4 29583030 4 29582356 5 29582958 5 29582958 5 29582958 5 29583030 5 29583031 5 29583049 5 29582247 6 29582356 6 29582457 6 29582651 6 29582939 6 29582956 6 29582958 6 29582958 6 29582958 6 29582957 6 29582960 6 29582972 6 2958
