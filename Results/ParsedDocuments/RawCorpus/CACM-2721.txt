the digital simulation of river plankton population dynamicsthis paper deals with the development of amathematical model for and the digital simulation in fortran iv of phytoplankton and zooplankton populationdensities in a river using previously developed rate expressions in order to study the relationshipsbetween the ecological mechanisms involved the simulation parameters were varied illustrating theresponse of the ecosystem to different conditions including those corresponding to certain types of chemicaland thermal pollution as an investigation of the accuracy of the simulation methods a simulationof the actual population dynamics of asterionella in the columbia river was made based on approximationsof conditions in that river although not totally accurate the simulation was found to predict the generalannual pattern of plankton growth fairly well and specifically revealed the importance of the annualvelocity cycle in determining such patterns in addition the study demonstrates the usefulness ofdigital simulations in the examinations of certain aquatic ecosystems as well as in environmentalplanning involving such examinations.cacm september 1975claudson r m.digital simulation mathematical modeling planktonpopulation dynamics phytoplankton zooplankton river ecosystems ecological mechanisms environmental simulation,modeling ecosystems pollution environmental impact environmental planning3.12 3.19ca750903 jb january 6 1978 2:55 pm2721 5 27212721 5 27212721 5 2721
