methods of evaluating polynomial approximationsin function evaluation routinesthe method of nested multiplication is commonlyused in function evaluation routines to evaluate approximation polynomials new polynomial evaluationmethods have been developed in recent years which require fewer multiplications than nested multiplicationand may therefore be preferable for use in function evaluation routines although some of these methodsdo not appear to be practically useful because of rounding-error difficulties several methods of evaluatinglow-degree polynomials have been found to be satisfactory three such methods are described and illustrated.cacm march 1967file c t.ca670309 jb february 28 1978 1:08 pm1620 4 16201620 4 1620819 4 16201620 5 16201620 5 16201620 5 1620436 5 1620819 5 1620
