translation equationsinput limited transduction expressions or translation equations,are used to describe the syntax and left-context sensitive semantics for context-free languages a formal procedure is given for deriving froma set of translation equations the specifications for a pushdown translator.the translator consists of mealy form finite-state automata interactingby means of a pushdown stack within the framework described string recognition and parsing may be treated as special cases of the translation problem.cacm february 1970vere s.automata turing machines regular expression transductionexpression context-free languages translation recognizers,parsing meta-compilers pushdown transducer syntaxdirected compilers finite state automata4.10 4.12 4.20 5.22ca700203 jb february 14 1978 10:49 am1323 4 21121358 4 21121380 4 21121665 4 21121781 4 21121787 4 21121989 4 21122112 4 21122534 4 21122541 4 21122698 4 21122733 4 21122820 4 21123073 4 21123155 4 21122112 5 21122112 5 21122112 5 2112799 5 2112
