buffer allocation in merge-sortinga fixed buffer allocation for merge-sortingis presented here which minimizes the number of input-output operations for a given order of merge when sorting on movable arm disks the number of seeks is equal to the number of input-output operations,and the seek time usually controls the sort time first some standard terminology is introduced then the input buffer allocation method is described followed by an analysis of the improvement to be expectedover more conventional allocation this analysis makes use of a particular distribution function ananalysis of a completely different distribution is given which yields similar results this suggeststhat the results do not depend on a particular distribution function an optimum output buffer sizeis also determined it is concluded that this buffering allocation can significantly reduce the timeof merge sorting on movable arm disks when the input data are not random and that this output bufferallocation should be used whether the data is random or not.cacm july 1971ferguson d e.file item string merge sort seek time gamma distribution function4.41 5.31ca710706 jb february 3 1978 8:41 am1638 4 21762176 4 21762272 4 21762176 5 21762176 5 21762176 5 2176677 5 2176
