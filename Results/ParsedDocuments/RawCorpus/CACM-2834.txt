efficient generation of the binaryreflected gray code and its applicationsalgorithms are presented to generate the n-bitbinary reflected gray code and codewords of fixed weight in that code both algorithms are efficientin that the time required to generate the next element from the current one is constant applicationsto the generation of the combinations of n thingstaken k at a time the compositions of integers andthe permutations of a multiset are discussed.cacm september 1976bitner j r.ehrlich g.reingold e m.gray code combinations subsets compositions combinatorial computing5.39ca760905 jb january 4 1978 9:14 am2466 4 28342834 4 28342834 4 28342834 4 28342834 4 28342884 4 28343115 4 28343115 4 28343115 4 2834969 5 28342045 5 28342417 5 28342466 5 28342834 5 28342834 5 28342834 5 2834
