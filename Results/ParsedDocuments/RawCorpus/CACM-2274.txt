generating english discourse from semantic networksa system is described for generating englishsentences from a form of semantic nets in which the nodes are word-sense meanings and the paths areprimarily deep case relations the grammar used by the system is in the form of a network that imposesan ordering on a set of syntactic transformations that are expressed as lisp functions the generationalgorithm uses the information in the semantic network to select appropriate generation paths throughthe grammar the system is designed for use as a computational tool that allows a linguist to developand study methods for generating surface strings from an underlying semantic structure initial findingwith regard to form determiners such as voice form tense and mood some rules for embedding sentences,and some attention to pronominal substitution are reported the system is programmed in lisp1.5 and is available from the authors.cacm october 1972simmons r.slocum j.semantic nets grammars deep case relations,semantic generation discourse generation3.42 3.65ca721004 jb january 27 1978 3:10 pm2274 5 22742274 5 22742274 5 22742795 5 22741928 6 22741989 6 22742274 6 2274
