pdel-a language for partial differential equationsconventional computer methods available to solvecontinuous system problems characterized by partialdifferential equations are very time-consuming and cumbersome aconvenient easy to learn and to use high level problem orientedlanguage to solve and study partial differential equation problemshas been designed a practical translator for the language has alsobeen designed and a working version of it has been constructedfor a significant portion of the language this partial differentialequation language pdel is outlined and the highlightsof the translator are briefly summarized.cacm march 1970cardenas a f.karplus w j.problem oriented or digital simulation language,partial differential equations translator,pl/1 preprocessor pl/1 finite difference algorithms3.1 3.2 4.22 5.17ca700307 jb february 13 1978 4:18 pm1379 4 20911503 4 20911542 4 20911683 4 20911693 4 20911693 4 20911781 4 20911781 4 20911781 4 20911787 4 20911836 4 20911836 4 20911860 4 20911945 4 20911945 4 20912015 4 20912060 4 20912060 4 20912061 4 20912061 4 20912082 4 20912091 4 20912091 4 20912091 4 20912152 4 20912179 4 20912179 4 20912340 4 20912356 4 20912546 4 20912546 4 20912603 4 20912698 4 20912698 4 20912708 4 20912708 4 20912824 4 20912982 4 20912986 4 20913045 4 20913045 4 20913093 4 20911366 5 20911477 5 20911491 5 20912091 5 20912091 5 20912091 5 2091
