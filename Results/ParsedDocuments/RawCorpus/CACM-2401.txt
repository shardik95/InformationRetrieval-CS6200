on shrinking binary picture patternsa parallel processing algorithm for shrinkingbinary patterns to obtain single isolated elements one for each pattern is presented this proceduremay be used for counting patterns on a matrix and a hardware implementation of the algorithm using largescale integrated technology is envisioned the principal features of this method are the very smallwindow employed two-by-two elements the parallel nature of the process and the possibility of shrinkingany pattern regardless of the complexity of its configuration problems regarding merging and disconnectionof patterns during the process as well as the determination of the maximum number of stepsnecessary to obtain a single isolated element from a pattern are reviewed and discussed an analogy with aneural network description in terms of mcculloch-pitts neurons is presented.cacm january 1972levialdi s.counting binary patterns shrinking parallelprocessing multiple connected pictures3.63ca720102 jb february 1 1978 9:43 am2401 5 24012401 5 24012401 5 2401
