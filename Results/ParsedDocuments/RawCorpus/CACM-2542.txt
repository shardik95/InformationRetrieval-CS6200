a software design and evaluation systema critical failure of current software systemdesign and implementation methodology is that the performance of a proposed design is not evaluatedbefore it is actually implemented in this paper the reasons for this failure are explored and a new methodologywhich overcomes many of the difficulties is proposed a system which integrates performance evaluationwith design and implementation is described this system is based on a simple high level languagewhich is used to describe the evolving system at all stages of its development the source languagedescription is used as direct input to performance analysis and simulation routines using the performanceinformation obtained from these routines as feedback the problems which adversely affect performanceare detected early enough so that they can be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.cacm february 1973graham r m.clancy g j jr.devaney d b.operating system development language processingsoftware evaluation compilers system programming supervisory systems debugging program maintenance,modeling system integration simulation4.0 4.12 4.22 4.30 4.42 4.43 8.1ca730206 jb january 24 1978 2:07 pm2542 5 25422542 5 25422542 5 2542
