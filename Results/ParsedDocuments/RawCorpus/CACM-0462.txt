computer pattern recognition techniques electrocardiographic diagnosisthe use of programmed digital computers as generalpattern classification and recognition devices is one phase of the current lively interest in artificialintelligence it is important to choose a class of signals which is at present undergoing agood deal of visual inspection by trained people for the purpose of pattern recognition in this waycomparisons between machine and human performance may be obtained a practical result also serves as additionalmotivation clinical electrocardiograms make up such a class of signals the approach to theproblem presented here centers upon the use of multiple adaptive matched filters that classify normalizedsignals the present report fives some of the background for the application of this method.cacm october 1962stark,l.okajima m.whipple g h.ca621018 jb march 17 1978 7:04 pm1325 5 462462 5 462462 5 462462 5 462462 6 462
