on the distributions of significant digits and roundoff errorsgeneralized logarithmic law is derived forthe distribution of the first t significant digits of a random digital integer this result is then usedto determine the distribution of the roundoff errors in floating-point operations which is a mixtureof uniform and reciprocal distributions.cacm may 1974tsao n.significant digits floating-point operations,roundoff errors uniform distribution reciprocal distribution variance mean valve5.10 5.11ca740504 jb january 17 1978 4:12 pm2649 5 26492649 5 26492649 5 2649
