storage-efficient representation of decimal datausually n decimal digits are represented by4n bits in computers actually two bcd digits can be compressed optimally and reversibly into 7 bits,and three digits into 10 bits by a very simple algorithm based on the fixed-length combination of twovariable field-length encodings in over half of the cases the compressed code results from the conventionalbcd code by simple removal of redundant 0 bits a long decimal message can be subdivided intothree-digit blocks and separately compressed the result differs from the asymptotic minimum lengthby only 0.34 percent the hardware requirement is small and the mappings can be done manually.cacm january 1975chi chen t.ho i t.binary-coded decimal digits decimal data storage6.32 6.34ca750110 jb january 12 1978 9:42 am2729 5 28012801 5 28012801 5 28012801 5 28012288 6 28012801 6 2801
