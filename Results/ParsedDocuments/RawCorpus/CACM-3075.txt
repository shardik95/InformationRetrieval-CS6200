fast parallel sorting algorithmsa parallel bucket-sort algorithm is presentedthat requires time o(log n and the use of n processors the algorithm makes use of a technique thatrequires more space than the product of processors and time a realistic model is used model is used in whichno memory contention is permitted a procedure is also presented to sort n numbers in time o(k logn using n 1  1/k processors for k an arbitrary integer the model of computation for this procedurepermits simultaneous fetches from the same memory location.cacm august 1978hirschberg d.parallel processing sorting algorithms bucket sort3.74 4.34 5.25 5.31ca780803 dh february 7 1979 10:25 am2714 4 30753075 4 30753075 4 30753075 4 30753075 4 30753085 4 30753156 4 30752289 5 30752557 5 30752664 5 30752714 5 30753075 5 30753075 5 30753075 5 30753156 5 30752289 6 30752973 6 30753075 6 3075
