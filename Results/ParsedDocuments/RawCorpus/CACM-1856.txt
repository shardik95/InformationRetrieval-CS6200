the teachable language comprehender a simulation program and theory of languagethe teachable language comprehender tlc isa program designed to be capable of being taught to comprehend english text when text which the programhas not seen before is input to it it comprehends that text by correctly relating each explicit or implicit)assertion of the new text to a large memory this memory is a semantic network representing factualassertions about the world the program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which havebeen found to relate to the new text adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of thenew text by this means the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded intothe same format as that of the memory in this form it can be added into the memory both factualassertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior contentare to be taught to the program as they are needed tlc presently contains a relatively small number ofexamples of such assertions and capabilities but within the system notations for expressing either of theseare provided thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language andit provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehendtext of any particular kind the memory structure and comprehension process of tlc allow new factual assertionsand capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically thatis once such an assertion or capability is put into the system it becomes available to help comprehenda great many other sentences in the future thus the addition of a single factual assertion orlinguistic capability will often provide a large increment in tlc's effective knowledge of the world andin its overall ability to comprehend text the program's strategy is presented as a general theory of language comprehension.cacm august,1969quillian m r.natural language processing natural language comprehension,teachable computer program psychological simulation human memory simulation computerlinguistics linguistic performance theory3.36 3.42 3.62 3.65 3.74ca690807 jb february 15 1978 5:46 pm1155 4 18561350 4 18561456 4 18561468 4 18561515 4 18561659 4 18561699 4 18561856 4 18561856 4 18561856 4 18562050 4 18562127 4 18561225 5 18561324 5 18561553 5 18561856 5 18561856 5 18561856 5 18562127 5 18562309 5 18562310 5 18562396 5 18561155 6 18561324 6 18561487 6 18561487 6 18561527 6 18561781 6 18561856 6 18561856 6 18561856 6 18561856 6 18562092 6 18562127 6 18562398 6 1856
