is sometime sometimes better than always intermittentassertions in proving program correctness)this paper explores a technique for proving thecorrectness and termination of programs simultaneously this approach the intermittent-assertion method involvesdocumenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control passes throughthe corresponding point but that need not be true every time the method introduced by burstall promisesto provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods the intermittent-assertion methodis presented with a number of examples of correctness and termination proofs some of these proofs are markedlysimpler than their conventional counterparts on the other hand it is shown that a proof of correctnessor termination by any of the conventional techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof usingintermittent assertions finally it is shown how the intermittent-assertion method can be appliedto prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs.cacm february 1978manna z.waldinger r.intermittent assertions correctness of programs,termination of programs program verification program transformation continuously operating programs.5.24ca780209 jb march 28 1978 2:04 pm2021 4 30142222 4 30142227 4 30142315 4 30142326 4 30142470 4 30142732 4 30142865 4 30142896 4 30142943 4 30143014 4 30143014 4 30143068 4 30143077 4 30143143 4 30141834 5 30142981 5 30143014 5 30143014 5 30143014 5 30143157 5 30143014 6 3014
