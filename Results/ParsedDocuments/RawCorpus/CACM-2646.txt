a model for masking rotational latency by dynamic disk allocationthis paper presents the background and algorithmsfor masking the rotational latency of a disk or drum it discusses the anticipatory input and outputof blocks of data to buffer and primary memories for a mono-programmed computer system a basic permutationalgorithm and several variations are given because of the anticipatory nature of the i/o scheduling,these algorithms are restricted to classes of programs with predictable behavior while the methodsare not restricted to numerical computations matrix and partial differential equation methods aretypical examples of their use it is shown that latency may be masked using a small amount of buffermemory the methods discussed are independent of the overall size of the data base being considered.cacm may 1974gold d e.kuck d j.buffer memory memory hierarchy permutation algorithm,rotational latency staging storage allocation4.41 6.20ca740507 jb january 17 1978 3:59 pm2646 5 26462646 5 26462646 5 2646
