on the interface between computers and data communications systemsfuture systems that combine computers digitalterminals and communications equipment present design optimization problems that require reconsiderationof the traditional functional responsibilities of the respective subsystems several standard interfaces,by means of which computers and digital terminals connect to the communications systems willbe required when specifying these interfaces consideration must be given to problems of coordination,synchronization error control signaling stream multiplexing and switch control in addition to minimizingthe technological interdependence of specific subsystem designs a focus on some of the problems isobtained in a discussion of a detailed specification for a particular computer-communications system interface.cacm july 1972fraser a g.communications standard interface communicationsprotocol virtual channel multiplexed input/output coordination of input/output3.81 6.0 6.35ca720707 jb january 30 1978 2:46 pm2321 5 23212321 5 23212321 5 2321
