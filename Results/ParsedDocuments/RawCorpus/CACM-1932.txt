the logarithmic error and newton's method for the square rootthe problem of obtaining optimal starting valuesfor the calculation of the square root using newton's method is considered it has been pointed outelsewhere that if relative error is used as the measure of goodness of fit optimal results are notobtained when the initial approximation is a best fit it is shown here that if instead the so-calledlogarithmic error is used then a best initial fit is optimal for both types of error moreover useof the logarithmic error appears to simplify the problem of determining the optimal initial approximation.cacm february 1969king r f.phillips d l.square root newton's method relative error logarithmicerror best fit optimal approximation maximal error recurrence relation integer root error curve5.12 5.13ca690206 jb february 20 1978 10:55 am1440 4 19321932 4 19321932 4 19322094 4 19322159 4 1932962 5 19321566 5 19321832 5 19321932 5 19321932 5 19321932 5 19321999 5 19322159 5 1932962 6 19321932 6 19321932 6 19321932 6 1932
