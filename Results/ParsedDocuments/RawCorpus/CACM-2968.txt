a comparison of tree-balancing algorithmsseveral algorithms-height-balance i.e avland extensions weight-balance i.e bb and wb and total restructuring-for building balanced binary searchtrees are compared the criteria for comparison encompass theoretical aspects e.g path lengths and implementationindependent and machine/algorithm-dependent measures e.g run time a detailed analysis of code isalso presented at a level believed to be language-and compiler-independent the quality of the resultingtrees and the overhead spent on building them are analyzed and some guidelines are given for an efficientuse of the methods if insertion and subsequent queries are the only operations of in terest then pure"avl trees present the overall best qualities.cacm may 1977baer j l.schwab b.binary search trees avl trees weight-balanced trees,path length analysis of algorithms information storage and retrieval3.7 3.72 3.74 5.31ca770504 jb december 29 1977 2:16 am2455 4 29682493 4 29682889 4 29682889 4 29682968 4 29682968 4 29683042 4 29682388 5 29682455 5 29682968 5 29682968 5 29682968 5 29683042 5 29682455 6 29682839 6 29682889 6 29682968 6 2968
