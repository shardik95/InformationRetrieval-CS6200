computer generation of gamma random variablesa new method for generating random variablesfrom the gamma distribution with nonintegral shape parameter a is proposed this method is similar to twoother methods recently given by wallace and fishman it is compared with fishman's and ahrens and dieter's methods the core storage requirements and programming effort for this method are similar to those of fishman'smethod the proposed method is the same as fishman's method for 1  a  2 and is faster than fishman'smethod for 3  a  19 also the proposed method is much simpler than ahrens and dieter's method and is faster for a  8 cacm may 1978tadikamalla p.gamma variables rejection method computer methods5.5 8.1ca780509 dh february 26 1979 1:10 pm2847 4 30982928 4 30983046 4 30983046 4 30983098 4 30983098 4 30983107 4 30982569 5 30982847 5 30983046 5 30983098 5 30983098 5 30983098 5 30982569 6 30982847 6 30983098 6 3098
