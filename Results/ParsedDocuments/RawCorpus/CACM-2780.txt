on computing certain elements of the inverse of a sparse matrixa recursive algorithm for computing the inverseof a matrix from the lu factors based on relationships in takahashi et al is examined the formulas for thealgorithm are given the dependency relationships are derived the computational costs are developed and somegeneral comments on application and stability are made.cacm march 1975erisman e m.tinney w f.sparse matrices triangular factorization elementsof inverse tridiagonal matrix sensitivities3.24 5.14ca750308 jb january 9 1978 4:34 pm 2780 5 27802780 5 27802780 5 2780
