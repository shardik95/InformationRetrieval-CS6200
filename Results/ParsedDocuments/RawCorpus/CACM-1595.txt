on the computer enumeration of finite topologiesthe problem of enumerating the number of topologieswhich can be formed from a finite point set is considered both theoretically and computationally certain fundamental results are established leading to an algorithm for enumerating finite topologies,and computed results are given for n  7 an interesting side result of the computational workwas the unearthing of a theoretical error which had been induced into the literature the use of the computerin combinatorics represents chronologically an early application and this side result underscoresits continuing usefulness in this area.cacm may 1967evans j w.harary f.lynn m s.ca670507 jb february 28 1978 10:37 am1595 5 15951595 5 15951595 5 1595
