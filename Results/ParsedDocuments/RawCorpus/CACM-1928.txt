exclusive simulation of activity in digital networksa technique for simulating the detailed logicnetworks of large and active digital systems is described essential objectives sought are improvedease and economy in model generation economy in execution time and space and a facility for handlingsimultaneous activities the main results obtained are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioralmodel description a reduction of manual tasks in converting boolean logic into a structural model,the elimination of manual processes in achieving exclusive simulation of activity an event-schedulingtechnique which does not deteriorate in economyas the event queue grows in length and a simulationprocedure which deals effectively with any mixture of serial and simultaneous activities the passage oftime is simulated in a precise quantitative fashion and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronousand asynchronous logic certain aspects of the techniques described may be used for the simulationof network structures other than digital networks.cacm february 1969ulrich e g.simulation logical simulation digital simulation,large systems simulation network structures scheduling queuing simultaneous activities parallel events4.22 4.29 6.9ca690210 jb february 20 1978 9:58 am1885 5 19281928 5 19281928 5 19281928 5 19282795 5 19281928 6 19281928 6 19281989 6 19282274 6 1928
