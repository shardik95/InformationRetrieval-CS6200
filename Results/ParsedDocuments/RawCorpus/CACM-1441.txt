methods of numerical integration applied toa system having trivial function evaluationsa study has been made to determine which methodsof numerical integration require the least computation time for a given amount of truncation errorwhen applied to a particular system of ordinary differential equations where function evaluations arerelatively trivial recent methods due to butcher and gear are compared with classic runge-kutta kutta-nystromand adams methods some of the newer one-step methods due to butcher are found to be slightly superior,but no one method is found to have any great advantage over the others in the application to this particular problem.cacm april 1966waters j.ca660408 jb march 3 1978 10:37 am1441 5 14411441 5 14411441 5 1441
