one-line random number generators and their use in combinationssome one-line random number generators i.e.generators requiring a single fortran instruction are discussed and some short fortran programs whichmix several such generators are described the aim is to provide methods for incorporating random numbergenerators directly in fortran programs by means of a few in-line instructions the advantages arespeed avoiding linkage to and from a subroutine convenience and versatility anyone wishing to experimentwith generators either using congruential generators by themselves or mixing several generatorsto provide a composite with potentially better statistical properties than the library generatorscurrently available may wish to consider some of the simple fortran program discussed here cacm november 1968marsaglia g.bray t a.random number generation monte carlo simulation5.5ca681105 jb february 21 1978 2:54 pm1674 4 16741691 4 16741293 5 16741674 5 16741674 5 16741674 5 16741794 5 16741870 5 16742122 5 16741674 6 16741674 6 16741674 6 16741691 6 1674
