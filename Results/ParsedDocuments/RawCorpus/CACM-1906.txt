automated printed circuit routing with a stepping aperturea computer program for routing interconnectionson a two-sided printed circuit board with a regular pattern of lines pins terminals and vias(feed-through holes is described in this program each interconnection is given a planned routing-typically,down from the upper pin through a via and horizontally to the lower pin from the top a virtualaperture i.e a long horizontal slit is stepped down the board the planned routing is the basis forrerouting interconnections within the aperture to resolve conflicts for lines and vias below the apertureand to maximize the effective line usage if a conflict has not been resolved before the aperturearrives at the lower pin,interconnections are deleted to resolve the conflict extensions of this techniqueto the control of crosstalk between routed interconnections and to the problem of obtaining100 percent interconnect are also discussed.cacm may 1969lass s.routing printed circuit interconnections aperture,stepping aperture computer program circuit board lines vias pins3.24 6.30ca690503 jb february 17 1978 3:57 pm 1211 4 19061549 4 19061906 4 19062902 4 19061051 5 19061906 5 19061906 5 19061906 5 1906
