productivity of multiprogrammed computers-progressin developing an analytic prediction methodmultiprogramming as it is discussed here isa mode of computer operation in which two or moreprograms are concurrently in processor memory and proceeding,each using the same central processor unit cpu and input-output i/o channels these programsare actually proceeding intermittently and singly according to eligibility readiness to proceed and priority it is useful to be able to represent them as proceeding continuously and simultaneously eachat an effective rate which may be a fraction of that which it would enjoy in the absence of the otherprograms the effective progress rate of each program is sensitive to many detailed characteristicsof itself and its co-residents and simulation has been the best available method of predicting it thispaper presents the results of progress in developing an alternative to simulation a simulation-tested iterativecomputation of these rates under certain situations the algorithm is sensitive to most of thefactors that control the phenomenon including nonquantitative or topological features of the programs structures.cacm december 1969lasser d j.productivity prediction multiprogramming simulation,equipment evaluation hardware evaluation monitor operating system system software supervisors,performance time sharing time slicing 2.43 2.44 4.32ca691207 jb february 15 1978 2:47 pm1805 4 18051805 4 18051805 4 18051828 4 18051846 4 18051854 4 18051892 4 18051912 4 18052187 4 18052188 4 18052218 4 18052317 4 18051518 5 18051572 5 18051748 5 18051805 5 18051805 5 18051805 5 18053070 5 18051805 6 18052454 6 18052741 6 18052988 6 1805
