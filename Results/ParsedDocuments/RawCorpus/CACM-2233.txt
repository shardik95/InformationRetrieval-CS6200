signature simulation and certain cryptographic codesthree cyphers allegedly authored by thomasjefferson beale in 1822 have been the subject of intensive study for over 100 years generations ofcryptanalysts have expended untold man-years thus far without success attempting tode code them vast armiesof fortune hunters and treasure seekers have devoted herculean labors to digging up the rolling hillsof virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza the history of pertinent activities would fill volumes,yet serious students of cryptography have always had nagging doubts about the cyphers authenticity it has been alleged that the known solution to cypher number two 115 73 24 818 37 52 49,ihave deposited in the county of bedford about four miles from buford's in an excavation or vault.with the aid of an unsanitized version of the declaration of independence was merely a superb imaginative,and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago for whatever reasons modern computer technology couldobviously perform signature analyses the process of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeperinsights into their construction for the benefit of the uninitiated the encoding method used in thesecond cypher employs a specified document whose words are simply numbered consecutively and first lettersof these words are sought out at random to match the letters of these words are sought out at randomto match the letters of the clear text or message the sequence of numbers corresponding to these matchesis then written down as the final code while primitive the process has the advantage of relativesecurity until the source document becomes known at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by secondgraders the work now completed with the help of our univac 1108 includes numerous analytical studiesof the beale cyphers and various types of simulations for example we have turned the entire process ofsimulated encoding by various schemes over to the machine and analyzed the signatures of these syntheticcodes we have also encoded various messages by hand using different texts and a variety of methods toobtain their signatures these simulations provide convincing evidence that the signatures are both processand data dependent they indicate also very strongly that mr beale's cyphers are for real and thatit is merely a matter of time before someone finds the correct source document and locates theright vault in the common-wealth of virginia.cacm january 1971hammer c.thomas jefferson beale codes cryptanalysis cyphers,decoding declaration of independence encoding magna carta pseudotext signature simulation3.42 3.63 3.65 3.71ca710101 jb february 8 1978 1:15 pm2233 5 22332233 5 22332233 5 2233
