convex hulls of finite sets of poin ts in two and three dimensionsthe convex hulls of sets of n poin ts in twoand three dimensions can be determined with o(n log n operations the presented algorithms use the divideand conquer technique and recursively apply a merge procedure for two nonin tersecting convex hulls since any convex hull algorithm requires at least o(n log n operations the time complexity of theproposed algorithms is optimal within a multiplicative constant.cacm february 1977preparata f p.hong s j.computational complexity convex hull optimal algorithms,planar set of poin ts spatial set of poin ts4.49 5.25 5.32ca770203 jb december 30 1977 2:47 am2997 4 29972737 5 29972997 5 29972997 5 29972997 5 29973151 5 29972997 6 2997
