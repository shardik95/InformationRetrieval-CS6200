dynamic memory repackinga probabilistic model of a multiprogramming systemis exercised in order to determine the conditions under which the dynamic repacking of main memory is beneficial an expression is derived for the maximum interference that a repacking process may introducebefore the original performance of the system is degraded alternative approaches to repacking are discussed,and the operating conditions that lead to improved system throughput through repacking are delineated.cacm march 1974balkovich e.chiu w.presser l.wood r.dynamic memory repacking memory compaction,storagefragmentation multiprogramming system model probabilistic model central processor productivity,resource utilization system throughput4.32 5.5 6.20ca740302 jb january 18 1978 12:37 pm2681 4 26812218 5 26812681 5 26812681 5 26812681 5 2681
