algorithms to reveal properties of floating-point arithmetictwo algorithms are presented in the form offortran subroutines each subroutine computes the radix and number of digits of the floating-pointnumbers and whether rounding or chopping is done by the machine on which it is run the methods areshown to work on any reasonable floating-point computer.cacm november 1972malcolm m a.floating-point arithmetic high-levellanguages philosophy of language design4.9 5.19ca721102 jb january 27 1978 2:39 pm2267 5 22672267 5 22672267 5 22672647 5 22672792 5 22672267 6 22672267 6 22672647 6 2267
