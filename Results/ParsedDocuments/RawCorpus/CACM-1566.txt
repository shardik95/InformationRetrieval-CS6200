optimal starting values for newton-raphson calculation of sqrt(x)the problem of obtaining starting values forthe newton-raphson calculation of sqrt(x on a digital computer is considered it is shown that theconventionally used best uniform approximations to sqrt(x do not provide optimal starting values the problem of obtaining optimal starting values the problem of obtaining optimal starting values isstated and several basic results are proved a table of optimal polynomial starting values is given.cacm july 1967moursund d g.ca670707 jb february 28 1978 8:53 am1566 4 15661440 5 15661566 5 15661566 5 15661566 5 15661932 5 15662094 5 1566962 6 15661566 6 15661566 6 1566
