time clocks and the ordering of events in a distributed systemthe concept of one event happening beforeanother in a distributed system is examined andis shown to define a partial ordering of the events a distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totallyorder the events the use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronizationproblems the algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks and a bound is derivedon how far out of synchrony the clocks can become cacm july 1978lamport l.distributed systems computer networks,clock synchronization multiprocess systems4.32 5.29ca780706 dh february 7 1979 4:30 pm3082 5 30823082 5 30823082 5 30823128 5 30822150 6 30822376 6 30822436 6 30822597 6 30822865 6 30822866 6 30822870 6 30822912 6 30823082 6 3082
