assembling code for machines with span-dependent instructionsmany modern computers contain instructionswhose lengths depend on the distance from a given instance of such an instruction to the operand of thatinstruction this paper considers the problem of minimizing the lengths of programs for such machines an efficient solution is presented for the case in which the operand of every such span-dependent"instruction is either a label or an assembly-time expression of a certain restricted formf this restrictionis relaxed by allowing these operands to be more general assembly-time expressions thenthe problem is shown to be np-complete.cacm april 1978szymanski t.span-dependent instructions variable-length addressing,code generation assemblers compilers np-complete computational complexity.4.11 4.12 5.25ca780406 dh february 26 1979 3:49 pm2626 4 31102786 4 31102840 4 31102858 4 31102919 4 31103017 4 31103110 4 31103110 4 31103110 4 31103174 4 31102194 5 31102629 5 31102858 5 31103110 5 31103110 5 31103110 5 3110
