a general method of systematic interval computationfor numerical integration of initial value problemsa procedure is given for continuously computingand monitoring the step size to be used by a self-starting p-th order numerical integration methodto solve an initial value problem the procedure uses an estimate of the truncation error to calculate the step size.cacm october 1966martin w c.paulson k c.sashkin l.ca661004 jb march 2 1978 4:05 pm1363 5 13631363 5 13631363 5 1363
