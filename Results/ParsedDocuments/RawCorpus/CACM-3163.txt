an optimal insertion algorithm for one-sidedheight-balanced binary search treesan algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced(oshb binary search tree is presented the algorithm operates in time o(log n where n is the number of nodes inthe tree this represents an improvement over the best previously known insertion algorithms of hirschberg and kosaraju which requiretime o(log 2n moreover the o(log n complexity is optimal earlier results have shown that deletion in such a structure canalso be performed in o(log n time thus the result of this papergives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees shouldbe the first examples of their kind where deletion has a smaller time complexity than insertion furthermore it can now be concludedthat insertion deletion and retrieval in oshb trees canbe performed in the same time as the corresponding operations forthe more general avl trees to within a constant factor however,the insertion and deletion algorithms for oshb trees appear muchmore complicated than the corresponding algorithms for avl trees.cacm september 1979raiha,k.zweben s.insertion one-sided height-balanced trees height-balancedtrees binary trees search trees.3.73 3.74 4.34 5.25 5.31ca790904 db january 14 1980 11:47 am2839 4 31633009 4 31633042 4 31633042 4 31633065 4 31633065 4 31633096 4 31633096 4 31633096 4 31633163 4 31633163 4 31633163 4 31633163 4 31633163 4 31632839 5 31632889 5 31633009 5 31633065 5 31633096 5 31633163 5 31633163 5 31633163 5 3163
