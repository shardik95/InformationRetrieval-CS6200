a comparison of numerical techniques in markov modelingthis paper presents several numerical methods whichmay be used to obtain the stationary probability vectors of markovian models an example of a nearlydecomposable system is considered and the results obtained by the different methods examined a postmortem reveals why standard techniques often fail to yield the correct results finally a means of estimatingthe error inherent in the decomposition of certain models is presented.cacm february 1978stewart w.markov models numerical techniques simultaneousiteration near-decomposability4.6 5.14 8.1ca780207 jb march 28 1978 3:43 pm2374 4 30162481 4 30162669 4 30162863 4 30163016 4 30163016 4 30163052 4 30163070 4 30163153 4 30161901 5 30162741 5 30163016 5 30163016 5 30163016 5 3016
