a language for treating geometric patterns in a two-dimensional spacein this paper cadep a problem-oriented languagefor positioning geometric patterns in a two-dimensional space is presented although the language has beenspecifically designed for the automatic generation of integrated circuit masks it turns out to be wellsuited also for such other placement problems as architecture design urban planning logical and blockdiagram representation the design criteria the structure and the specific features of cadep are illustrated.cacm january 1971bracchi g.ferrari d.graphic language problem-oriented language two-dimensionalpatterns graphic display fortran extension layout problems integrated circuit,architecture design urban planning3.23 3.24 3.25 4.22ca710104 jb february 8 1978 11:17 am2230 4 22302003 5 22302044 5 22302230 5 22302230 5 22302230 5 2230996 6 22301558 6 22302230 6 2230521 6 2230
