a code for non-numeric information processingapplications in online systemsa code has been specifically designed to simplifythe internal information processing operations within an online computer system with respect to non-numericapplications and to maximize the transfer rate of the information channel linking the system andthe system user the code has direct application to problems in area such as information retrieval documentclassification computer-aided teaching and text editing this code called ipc information processingcode is an 8-bit code set constructed so that 7 6 5 and 4-bit subsets can be easily derivedfrom the basic set the code set is organized so that simple binary operations can distinguish betweenthe numeric alphabetic special symbol and control character codes the number of usable characters withinthe basic set size may be expanded either by use of escape codes included in the set or by suitableinterpretation of otherwise unassigned codes on the basis of the requirements of local environments.cacm january 1967morenoff e.mclean j b.ca670103 jb march 1 1978 9:05 am1652 5 16521652 5 16521652 5 1652
