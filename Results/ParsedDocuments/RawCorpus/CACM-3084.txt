interpolation search a log logn searchinterpolation search is a method of retrievinga desired record by key in an ordered file by using the value of the key and the statistical distributionof the keys it is shown that on the average log logn file accesses are required to retrieve a key,assuming that the n keys are uniformly distributed the number of extra accesses is also estimated and shownto be very low the same holds if the cumulative distribution function of the keys is known computationalexperiments confirm these results cacm july 1978perl y.itai a.avni h.average number of accesses binary search database,interpolation search retrieval searching uniform distribution 4.4 4.6 5.25ca780704 dh february 7 1979 4:50 pm3084 5 30843084 5 30843084 5 3084
