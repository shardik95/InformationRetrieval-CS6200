complex matrix inversion versus reala comparison of complex matrix with real matrix inversionis made it is shown that the complex inversion can be up to twice as fast as the real inversion further the rounding errorbound for complex inversion is about one-eighth that of real,for gaussian elimination using extended inner productaccumulation the bound is half of the real system.cacm september 1970ehrlich l w.complex matrix inversion matrix inversion inversion rounding errors,rounding error bound error bounds complex rounding error bounds5.14 5.11 5.10ca700907 jb february 10 1978 10:19 am1998 5 19981998 5 19981998 5 1998
