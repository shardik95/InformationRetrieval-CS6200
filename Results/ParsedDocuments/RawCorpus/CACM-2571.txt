an analytic model of the hasp execution task monitorthe hasp execution task monitor periodicallyrearranges the os/360 dispatching chain to give tasks preemptive execution priority in inverse order tothat of their cpu utilization history the effect is to keep the i/o bound tasks active and to preventcpu bound tasks from locking out other tasks this paper develops a simple model of the execution taskmonitor and employs it to study the effectiveness of the monitor in improving system performance amodified strategy monitor control is investigated for the case of task execution in a memory hierarchy of varying speeds.cacm december 1974strauss j c.hasp os/360 dispatching scheduling modeling performance evaluation4.32 8.1ca741203 jb january 16 1978 9:51 am2571 4 25713072 4 25713119 4 25712245 5 25712571 5 25712571 5 25712571 5 2571
