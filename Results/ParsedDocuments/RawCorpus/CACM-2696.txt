a method of bivariate interpolation and smoothsurface fitting based on local proceduresa method is designed for interpolating valuesgiven at points of a rectangular grid in a plane by a smooth bivariate function z=z(x,y the interpolatingfunction is a bicubic polynomial in each cell of the rectangular grid emphasis is an avoidingexcessive undulation between given grid points the proposed method is an extension of the method ofunivariate interpolation developed earlier by the author and is likewise based on local procedures.cacm january 1974akima h.bivariate interpolation interpolation partialderivative polynomial smooth surface fitting5.13ca740103 jb january 18 1978 2:38 pm2693 4 26962696 4 26962696 4 26962270 5 26962693 5 26962696 5 26962696 5 26962696 5 2696988 6 26962270 6 26962696 6 2696
