the reconstruction of binary patterns from their projectionsgiven the horizontal and vertical projectionsof a finite binary pattern f can we construct the original pattern f in this paper we give a characterizationof patterns that are reconstructable from their projection three algorithms are developedto reconstruct both unambiguous and ambiguous patterns it is shown that an unambiguous pattern canbe perfectly reconstructed in time m x n and that a pattern similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructedin time m x n where m n are the dimensions of the pattern frame.cacm january 1971chang s.pattern reconstruction image reconstruction datacompression pattern recognition integral geometry3.63 5.30ca710103 jb february 8 1978 12:33 pm2142 5 22312231 5 22312231 5 22312231 5 22312529 5 22311929 6 22312231 6 22312231 6 2231
