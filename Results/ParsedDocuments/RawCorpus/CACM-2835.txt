recursion analysis for compiler optimizationa relatively simple method for the detectionof recursive use of procedures is presented for use in compiler optimization implementation considerationsare discussed and a modification of the algorithm is given to further improve optimization this analysis can also be used to determine what possible subset of values could be assumed by variableswhich can only take on a relatively small discrete set of values the most common are parameters of variablesassuming values of label procedure or pascal's enumerated type.cacm september 1976walter k g.recursion compiler optimization4.12ca760904 jb january 4 1978 9:36 am2835 5 28352835 5 28352835 5 2835
