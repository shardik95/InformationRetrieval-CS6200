symbolic integration the stormy decadethree approaches to symbolic integration in the1960's are described the first from artificial intelligence led to slagle's saint and to a largedegree to moses sin the second from algebraic manipulation led to manove's implementation and tohorowitz and tobey's reexamination of the hermite algorithm for integrating rational functions the third,from mathematics led to richardson's proof of the unsolvability of the problem for a class of functionsand for risch's decision procedure for the elementary functionseneralizations of risch's algorithmto a class of special functions and programs for solving differential equations and for findingthe definite integral are also described.cacm august 1971moses j.integration symbolic integration definite integrals rational functions3.1 3.2 3.6 4.9 5.2 5.9ca710808 jb february 2 1978 2:48 pm2164 4 21642170 4 21642323 4 21642719 4 21642167 5 21642164 5 21642164 5 21642164 5 21642323 5 21642164 6 21642167 6 21642170 6 2164
