note on triple-precision floating-point arithmetic with 132-bit numbersin a recent paper gregory and raney describeda technique for double-precision floating-point arithmetic a similar technique can be developed fortriple-precision floating-point arithmetic and it is the purpose of this note to describe this technique only the multiplication and the division algorithms are described since the addition-subtractionalgorithm can be obtained by a trivial modification of the algorithm in gregory's and raney's paper.cacm march 1965ikebe y.ca650313 jb march 7 1978 5:54 pm1294 4 12941152 5 12941294 5 12941294 5 12941294 5 1294
