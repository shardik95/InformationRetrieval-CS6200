an interactive graphic display for regionpartitioning by linear programmingusing linear programming an interactive graphicdisplay system has been implemented to solve the region design problem of partitioning a region inton nonoverlapping subregions in such a way that their areas are in specified proportions and that thetotal cost of servicing them is a minimum in a conversational manner a user can easily obtain differentpartitionings by specifying and modifying the boundary the service centers locations the areaproportions and the cost functions examples are included.cacm september 1974cheung t.interactive graphic display region partitioning,area specification linear programming5.41 8.2 8.3ca740904 jb january 17 1978 8:56 am2604 4 26041977 5 26042604 5 26042604 5 26042604 5 2604
