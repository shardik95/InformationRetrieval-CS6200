anomalous behavior of the fifty-percentrule in dynamic memory allocationthis paper reports simulation data showingthat in dynamic memory allocation the average free-to-allocated-block ratio can differ considerablyand in both directions from the predictions of the 50 percent rule a new derivation is given and itis shown that previous derivations make an assumption that may be violated frequently on the basis of the simulationdata and the derivation it is hypothesized that the anomalous behavior results from the combinedeffects of systematic placement and the statistics of the release process additional simulations supportthis hypothesis systematic placement which refers to the natural convention of always allocatingstorage requests against the same end of the free block selected by the allocation strategy tends toorder blocks within contiguous groups according to their allocation time the degree of anomalous behaviordepends on the extent to which allocated blocks are released in the order of their allocation fornon-markovian release processes the extent of the correlation between allocation order and release ordervaries approximately inversely with the coefficient of variation of the memory residence time distribution the simulations show that allocation efficiency depends strongly on the residence time distribution efficiencydecreases as the distribution's coefficient of variation increases some practical implications are briefly discussed.cacm november 1977shore j e.dynamic memory allocation storage fragmentation,fifty-percent rule first-fit simulation3.73 4.32 4.34 4.35ca771105 jb december 27 1977 7:37 am2095 4 29112218 4 29112498 4 29112596 4 29112596 4 29112734 4 29112747 4 29112768 4 29112845 4 29112902 4 29112902 4 29112902 4 29112911 4 29112911 4 29112911 4 29112911 4 29112911 4 29112911 4 29112911 4 29112955 4 29112955 4 29112983 4 29113000 4 2911972 4 2911273 5 29111879 5 29112435 5 29112498 5 29112734 5 29112773 5 29112911 5 29112911 5 29112911 5 29112983 5 2911
