reduction a method of proving properties of parallel programswhen proving that a parallel program has agiven property it is often convenient to assume that a statement is indivisible i.e that the statementcannot be interleaved with the rest of the program here sufficient conditions are obtained to show thatthe assumption that a statement is indivisible can be relaxed and still preserve properties such ashalting thus correctness proofs of a parallel system can often be greatly simplified.cacm december 1975lipton r j.deadlock free reduction interruptible indivisible,parallel program semaphore verification method process computation sequence4.32 4.35 5.24ca751207 jb january 5 1978 3:59 pm2700 4 27003128 4 27002376 5 27002700 5 27002700 5 27002700 5 2700
