operations on generalized arrays with the genie compileroperations on vectors matrices and higher dimensional storage arrays are standard features of most compilers today the elements of such structures areusually restricted to be scalars for many sophisticated applicationsthis restriction can impose cumbersome data representations.an efficient system has been devised and implemented which allowsthe elements of multidimensional arrays to themselves be multidimensionalarrays this system was developed from a storage structurein which the location length and content of each array is describedby a codeword which can be interpreted by the system code words may describe arrays containing more codewords thus providingall needed descriptive information for hyperstructures of any form.cacm may 1970sitton g a.multidimensional arrays matrix operations,storage control subscripting compilers4.12 4.29ca700502 jb february 13 1978 2:18 pm2064 4 20641677 5 20642064 5 20642064 5 20642064 5 2064
