a unifying approach to schedulingthis paper presents a scheme for classifyingscheduling algorithms based on an abstract model of a scheduling system which formalizes the notion ofpriority various classes of scheduling algorithmsare defined and related to existing algorithms acriterion for the implementation efficiency of an algorithm is developed and results in the definitionof time-invariant algorithms which include most of the commonly implemented ones for time-invariantalgorithms the dependence of processing rates on priorities is derived the abstract model providesa framework for implementing flexible schedulers in real operating systems the policy-driven schedulerof bernstein and sharp is discussed as an example of such an implementationcacm july 1977ruschitzka m.fabry r s.scheduling algorithms scheduling models priority,operating systems,processor sharing implementation efficiency4.31 4.32 4.34 4.35 8.1ca770702 jb december 28 1977 12:32 pm2950 4 29503072 4 29502219 5 29502950 5 29502950 5 29502950 5 2950
