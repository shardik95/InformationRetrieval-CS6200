symbolic execution and program testingthis paper describes the symbolic execution ofprograms instead of supplying the normal inputs to a program e.g numbers one supplies symbols representingarbitrary values the execution proceeds as in a normal execution except that values may be symbolicformulas over the input symbols the difficult yet interesting issues arise during the symbolic executionof conditional branch type statements a particular system called effigy which provides symbolicexecution for program testing and debugging is also described it interpretively executes programs writtenin a simple pl/i style programming language it includes many standard debugging features the abilityto manage and to prove things about symbolic expressions a simple program testing manager and a programverifier a brief discussion of the relationship between symbolic execution and program proving is also included.cacm july 1976king j c.symbolic execution program testing program debugging,program proving program verification symbolic interpretation4.13 5.21 5.24ca760703 jb january 4 1978 12:59 pm2850 5 28502850 5 28502850 5 28503080 5 2850210 6 28502850 6 2850
