an algorithm for the probability ofthe union of a large number of eventsan algorithm is presented which efficiently evaluatesthe probability for the union of n independent and not mutually exclusive events the problem is thatof evaluating the sums of the products of all possible combinations of n variables in minimum time and storage space.cacm september 1968miller g d.algorithm probability optimum storage vs timecompromise set union mutually exclusive events5.12 5.5 5.6ca680907 jb february 22 1978 8:45 am1694 5 16941694 5 16941694 5 1694
