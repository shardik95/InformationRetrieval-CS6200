sampling from the gamma distribution on a computerthis paper describes a method of generatinggamma variates that appears to be less costly than wallace's recently suggested method for large shape parameter(a the cost of computation is proportional to a whereas wallace's method is proportional to a experimentation by robinson and lewis indicates that for small a the method suggested here also dominatesmethods recently suggested by dieter and ahrens albeit those methods dominate for large a themethod suggested here uses the rejection technique.cacm july 1976fishman g s.gamma variates reflection method sampling5.5 8.1 8.3ca760706 jb january 4 1978 12:34 pm2847 4 28472928 4 28473046 4 28473098 4 28473107 4 28472569 5 28472847 5 28472847 5 28472847 5 28473046 5 28473098 5 28472569 6 28472569 6 28472847 6 28472847 6 28473098 6 2847
