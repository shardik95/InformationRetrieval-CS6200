how to keep the addresses shortan algorithm is presented for minimizing thesum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced by an assembler or compiler when 1 the length ofeach computer instruction is assumed to be either long or short long if the memory location addressedis more than a predetermined distance from the current location short otherwise and 2)there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings origins are separated by prespecified amounts for example,some computers permit either 8-bit addressing interpreted relative to the location counter or full16-bit addressing of all of memory when assembling or compiling two or more blocks of instructions whichhave many mutual references in such a computer there is no simple iterative procedure for keepingas many of the addresses short as possible this paper demonstrates that a wide class of problems ofthis type can be formulated as covering problems solvable by means of elementary arithmetic operationson the column vectors of a ternary matrix.cacm may 1971richards d l.addressing assembler covering problem integerprogramming variable-length addressing4.11 4.12 4.21 5.41ca710505 jb february 3 1978 2:40 pm2194 5 21942194 5 21942194 5 21942858 5 21943110 5 21942194 6 21942194 6 21942629 6 21942858 6 2194
