lg a language for analytic geometrya conversational programming language for analyticgeometry is described together with some aspects of its implementation the language allowsthe flexible definition of geometric objects and elements computes their parameters and displays the results.it also provides the capability of specifying a geometric figure via a collection of parameters anddisplaying various loci corresponding to these parameters a third characteristic consists of the possibilityof using this language to design other user oriented languages lg has been specifically designedfor use by nonprogrammers it is easy to learn and very close to the natural language used in geometry.cacm april 1976raymond j.interactive programming problem oriented languages,computer graphics interpreters analytic geometry3.20 4.13 4.22 4.9ca760403 jb january 4 1978 4:26 pm2873 5 28732873 5 28732873 5 2873
