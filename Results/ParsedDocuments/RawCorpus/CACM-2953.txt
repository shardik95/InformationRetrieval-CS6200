notes on recursion eliminationvarious methods of recursion elimination areapplied to the schematic recursive procedure proc s(x px then n(x s(fx s(gx m(x fi procedureswith this general form arise in connection with tree traversal and sorting algorithms each methodof recursion removal involves the use of one or more stacks and the solutions are comparedon the basis of their running time.cacm june 1977bird r s.recursion elimination optimization of programs,stacks trees sorting algorithms computational induction4.0 4.2 5.20 5.24 5.25 5.31ca770610 jb december 28 1977 12:50 pm2953 5 29532953 5 29532953 5 29533020 5 29532953 6 2953
