a lightpen-controlled program for on-line data analysisthis paper describes a technique designedto ease the use of a data processing system by a person in particular a scientist who is intimately andprimarily concerned with interpreting the significance of data handled by the system since such a person isoften unable to spend the time necessary to master a programming language it is essential that he be aidedin composing commands to the computer in the system described the user is not required to learnor remember the vocabulary of the language because the vocabulary is displayed before him on"menus bymeans of a computer-drive scope he selects the various vocabulary elements required by pointing withthe light pen by use of a small unordered set of rewriting rules applied as a result of light penselections the user generates only syntacticallycorrect commands to the system he does not have to learnor remember the grammar the program restricts the user severely in the particular language he can use,but the method for communicating with the program makes these restrictions seem quite natural and unconstraining the program has been used successfully for over ten months.cacm february 1965goodenough j b.ca650217 jb march 7 1978 10:40 pm1307 5 13071307 5 13071307 5 13071978 5 13071307 6 13071589 6 13071813 6 1307
