a generalization of avl treesa generalization of avl trees is proposed inwhich imbalances up to triangle shape is a small integer an experiment is performed to compare thesetrees with standard avl trees and with balanced trees on the basis of mean retrieval time of amountof restructuring expected and on the worst case of retrieval time it is shown that by permittingimbalances of up to five units the retrieval time is increased a small amount while the amount of restructuringrequired is decreased by a factor of ten a few theoretical results are derived including the correctionof an earlier paper and are duly compared with the experimental data reasonably good correspondence is found.cacm august 1973foster c c.avl trees balanced trees information storage and retrieval3.7 3.72 4.49 5.31ca730819 jb january 23 1978 10:13 am2455 4 24552455 4 24552493 4 24552889 4 24552968 4 24552278 5 24552388 5 24552455 5 24552455 5 24552455 5 24552889 5 24552968 5 24553042 5 24552138 6 24552388 6 24552388 6 24552455 6 24552455 6 24552455 6 24552839 6 24552889 6 24552968 6 2455
