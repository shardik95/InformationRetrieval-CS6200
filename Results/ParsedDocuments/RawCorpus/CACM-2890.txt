on quadratic adaptive routing algorithmstwo analytic models of a store-and-forward communicationsnetwork are constructed one to find the optimal message routing and the other to illustratethe equilibrium stationary state maintained by an adaptive routing algorithm these models show thatadaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary conditions for an optimal routing adaptive routing tendsto overuse the direct path and underuse alternate routes because it does not consider the impact of itscurrent routing decision on the future state of the network the form of the optimality conditions suggeststhat a modification of the adaptive algorithm will result in optimality the modification requiresthe substitution of a quadratic bias term instead of a linear one in the routing table maintained at eachnetwork node simulation results are presented which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.cacm january 1976agnew c e.routing algorithms adaptive routing quadratic routing,alternate routing store-and-forward network distributed network computer network message switching3.81 8.0 8.1 8.3ca760103 jb january 5 1978 10:37 am2890 5 28902890 5 28902890 5 2890
