experiments in automatic learning for a multipurpose heuristic programan automatic learning capability has been developedand implemented for use with the multiple multipurpose program that learns heuristic tree-searchingprogram which is presently being applied to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus.multiple's proving program pp uses two evaluation functions to guide its search for a proof of whetheror not a particular goal is achievable thirteen general features of predicate calculus clauses were createdfor use in the automatic learning of better evaluation functions for pp a multiple regressionprogram was used to produce optimal coefficients for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features also automatic data-handling routines were written for passing data between the learning programand the proving program and for analyzing and summarizing results data was generally collected forlearning regression analysis from the experience of pp a number of experiments were performed to testthe effectiveness and generality of the learning program results showed that the learning produced dramaticimprovements in the solutions to problems which were in the same domain as those used for collectionlearning data learning was also shown to generalize successfully to domains other than those usedfor data collection another experiment demonstrated that the learning program could simultaneously improveperformance on problems in a specific domain and on problems in a variety of domains some variationsof the learning program were also tested.cacm february 1971slagle j r.farrell c d.learning theorem-providing heuristic automaticlearning self-modifying,tree-searching artificial intelligence problem-solving adaptive lisp multiple regression resolution3.62 3.64ca710204 jb february 8 1978 9:33 am2217 5 22172217 5 22172217 5 2217
