a neliac-generated 7090-1401 compilerneliac systems for several different machineshave been generated using the original neliac system developed at the naval electronics laboratory,san diego in 1958 a basic bootstrap process was used to generate all but the first i.e the systemswere described in the neliac language and generated by an existing neliac compiler this experience hasshown there is no inherent difficulty in building compilers with compilers indeed it pointed out many advantagesin using a pol for constructing programming systems this report presents the results of a projectcompleted in may 1961 in which the neliac system was used to generate a compiler for the ibm 1401 the1401 compiler which runs on the 7090 and produces 1401 programs was described in the neliac language andgenerated with 7090 neliac system the reduction in programming time and the improvement in documentationof the system were very significant.cacm february 1962watt j b.wattenburg w h.ca620206 jb march 20 1978 3:52 pm1781 4 637637 4 637637 4 637123 4 637123 5 637165 5 637637 5 637637 5 637637 5 637
