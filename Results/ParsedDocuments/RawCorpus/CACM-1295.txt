pert time calculations without topological orderinga simplified technique is presented for perttime calculations without topological ordering each event is assigned a unique memory location an activityis represented by a link a link is defined as a memory location containing the address of anothermemory location the time information for an activity is carried with its link for a typical net,the majority of activities can be described by one 36-bit cell each the remainder use two 36-bitcells each the links are unidirectional forward during the t(e calculation expected completion time foran activity)backward during the t(l calculation time latest allowable for completion of an activity the calculations progress through the net topologically even though the net is not represented topologically in core.cacm march 1965lass s e.ca650312 jb march 7 1978 6:00 pm1295 5 12951295 5 12951295 5 12951611 5 12951295 6 1295340 6 1295
