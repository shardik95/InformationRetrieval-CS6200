an operating system based on the concept of a supervisory computeran operating system which is organized as asmall supervisor and a set of independent processes are described the supervisor handles i/o with externaldevices-the file and directory system-schedules active processes and manages memory handle errors andprovides a small set of primitive functions which it will execute for a process a process is able tospecify a request for a complicated action on the part of the supervisor usually a wait on the occurrenceof a compound event in the system by combining these primitives into a supervisory computer program the part of the supervisor which executes these programs may be viewed as a software implemented supervisorycomputer the paper develops these concepts in detail outlines the remainder of the supervisor anddiscusses some of the advantages of this approach.cacm march 1972gaines r s.operating systems supervisors multiprogramming,time-sharing cooperating processes4.30 4.31 4.32ca720303 jb january 31 1978 3:08 pm1458 4 23781523 4 23781603 4 23781698 4 23781747 4 23781748 4 23781854 4 23781877 4 23781960 4 23782319 4 23782377 4 23782378 4 23782378 4 23782320 4 23782497 4 23782558 4 23782625 4 23782632 4 23782632 4 23782738 4 23782740 4 23782840 4 23782868 4 23782941 4 23783105 4 23783127 4 23783144 4 23781471 5 23782080 5 23782378 5 23782378 5 23782378 5 2378
