recursive solution of a class of combinatorial problems an examplecombinatorial problems requiring the selectionof n elements from a set of m elements may be solved by a recursion process analogous to that forcomputing binomial coefficients several specific problems are analyzed the general technique is exposed,and an algol program is developed for one of the problems.cacm october 1965lynch,w c.ca651009 jb march 6 1978 6:40 pm1186 5 11861186 5 11861186 5 1186
