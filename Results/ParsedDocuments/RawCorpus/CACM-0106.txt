a method for overlapping and erasure of listsan important property of the newell-shaw-simonscheme for computer storage of lists is that data having multiple occurrences need not be storedat more than one place in the computer that is lists may be overlapped unfortunately overlappingposes a problem for subsequent erasure given a list that is no longer needed it is desired to erasejust those parts that do not overlap other lists in lisp mccarthy employs an elegant but inefficient solutionto the problem the present paper describes a general method which enables efficient erasure themethod employs interspersed reference counts to describe the extent of the overlapping.cacm december 1960collins g e.ca601210 jb march 20 1978 6:33 pm1024 4 1061051 4 1061102 4 1061132 4 1061390 4 1061486 4 1061549 4 1061706 4 1061826 4 1061878 4 106378 4 1062060 4 1062155 4 1062168 4 1062719 4 1062723 4 1062838 4 1062842 4 1062855 4 1062879 4 1063077 4 1063080 4 1063106 4 106627 4 106106 4 106106 5 106106 5 106106 5 1061050 5 106210 5 1061393 5 1061549 5 1062023 5 1063112 5 106627 5 106849 6 106106 6 106106 6 106106 6 106106 6 106106 6 106106 6 106196 6 1061051 6 1061380 6 106209 6 1061826 6 106210 6 106210 6 1061878 6 106296 6 1061972 6 106367 6 1062438 6 1062723 6 1062736 6 1062833 6 1062838 6 106406 6 106627 6 106627 6 106731 6 106731 6 106731 6 106753 6 106
