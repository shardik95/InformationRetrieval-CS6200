experimental investigations of the utilityof detailed flowcharts in programmingthis paper describes previous research onflowcharts and a series of controlled experiments to test the utility of detailed flowcharts as an aidto program composition comprehension debugging and modification no statistically significant differencebetween flowchart and nonflowchart groups has been shown thereby calling into question the utilityof detailed flowcharting a program of further research is suggested.cacm june 1977shneiderman b.mayer r.mckay d.heller p.flowcharts program composition program comprehension,debugging modification experimental testing human factors1.5 4.0ca770602 jb december 29 1977 1:33 am2961 4 29612961 5 29612961 5 29612961 5 2961721 5 2961
