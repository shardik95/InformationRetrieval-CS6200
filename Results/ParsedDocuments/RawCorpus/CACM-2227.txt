proof of a program finda proof is given of the correctness of thealgorithm find first a informal description is given of the purpose of the program and the methodused a systematic technique is described for constructing the program proof during the process of codingit in such a way as to prevent the intrusion of logical errors the proof of termination is treatedas a separate exercise finally some conclusions relating to general programming methodology are drawn.cacm january 1971hoare c a r.proofs of programs programming methodology programdocumentation program correctness theory of programming4.0 4.22 5.21 5.23 5.24ca710107 jb february 8 1978 10:40 am2021 4 22272222 4 22272227 4 22272227 4 22272315 4 22272326 4 22272470 4 22272732 4 22272783 4 22272865 4 22272896 4 22272943 4 22273014 4 22273054 4 22273068 4 22273077 4 22273143 4 22271834 5 2227307 5 22272227 5 22272227 5 22272227 5 22272356 5 22272420 5 22272874 5 22273143 5 2227970 6 22271491 6 22271682 6 22271834 6 22272227 6 22272227 6 22272227 6 22272227 6 22272317 6 22272683 6 22272871 6 2227521 6 2227
