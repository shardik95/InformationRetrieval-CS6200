normalization techniques for hand printed numeralsfamily of pattern standardizationtechniques based on geometrical projection is applied to a file ofdigitized hand printed numerals obtained from sales clerks theprinciple involves transforming a quadrilateral specified in termsof the convex hull of each pattern into a square the amount ofoverlap within each class of characters versus the amount between classesis used to evaluate the degree of normalization achieved with respect to other published methods including size and shear normalization through moments.cacm august 1970nagy g.tuong n.pattern recognition character recognition normalization,projective transformation central projection handprinted characters handwriting linear transformation,size normalization mapping pattern preprocessor3.63 5.14ca700802 jb february 10 1978 4:03 pm2019 5 20192019 5 20192019 5 2019
