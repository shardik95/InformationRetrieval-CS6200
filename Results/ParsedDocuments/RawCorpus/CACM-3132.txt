experiments with some algorithms that findcentral solutions for pattern classificationin two-class pattern recognition it is a standardtechnique to have an algorithm finding hyperplaneswhich separates the two classes in a linearly separable trainingset the traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates allpoints in the other but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centeredin the empty space between the two classes since a centralhyperplane does not favor one class or the other it should havea lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore betterthan a noncentral hyperplane six algorithms for finding centralhyperplanes are tested on three data sets although frequentlyused practice the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to bequite good.cacm march 1979slagle j.pattern recognition pattern classification linear discriminants centralhyperplanes centering centrality criteria dead zone hyperplane,linearly separable relaxation algorithm accelerated relaxation3.62 3.63ca790303 dh april 12 1979 3:20 pm3132 4 31322215 5 31323132 5 31323132 5 31323132 5 3132
