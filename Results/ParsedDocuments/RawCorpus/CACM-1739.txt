regular expression search algorithma method for locating specific character stringsembedded in character text is described and an implementation of this method in the form of a compileris discussed the compiler accepts a regular expression as source language and produces an ibm 7094program as object language the object program then accepts the text to be searched as input and producesa signal every time an embedded string in the text matches the given regular expression examples,problems and solution are also presented.cacm june 1968thompson k.search match regular expression3.74 4.49 5.32ca680606 jb february 22 1978 4:18 pm1739 5 17391739 5 17391739 5 17392545 5 17392746 5 17391665 6 17391739 6 17391739 6 17391781 6 17392139 6 17392341 6 17392545 6 17392786 6 1739
