integral equations of immunologythe inversion of a particular integral equationof the first fredholm kind is the basic problem considered the strategy which yielded success consistedof three essential points 1 fit the known experimental data by a curve with properties which derivefrom properties of the as yet unknown function 2 stabilize the computation for the unknown functionby using singular value decomposition 3 constrain the unknown function approximation since it representsa probability distribution to be nonnegative a number of test cases are presented one set of actualexperimental data is analyzed with the procedures presented.cacm october 1972hanson r j.integral equations of the first kind nonnegativeconstraints singular value analysis3.10 5.14 5.18 5.41ca721003 jb january 27 1978 3:37 pm2275 5 22752275 5 22752275 5 2275
