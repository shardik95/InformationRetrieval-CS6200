an algorithm for identifying the ergodic subchainsand transient states of a stochastic matrixan algorithm for identifying the ergodic subchainsand transient states of a stochastic matrixis presented applications in markov renewal programmingand in the construction of variable length codes are reviewed and an updating procedure for dealingwith certain sequences of stochastic matrices is discussed computation times are investigated experimentallyand compared with those of another recently propose method.cacm september 1968fox b l.landi d m.stochastic matrix ergodic chain identification5.39 5.5ca680905 jb february 22 1978 9:04 am1696 5 16961696 5 16961696 5 1696
