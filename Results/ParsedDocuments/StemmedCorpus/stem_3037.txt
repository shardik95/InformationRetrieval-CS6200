a linear siev algorithm for find prime number a newalgorithm is present for find all prime between 2 andn the algorithm execut in time proport to n assumthat multipl of integ not larger than n can beperform in unit time the method ha the same arithmetcomplex as the algorithm present by mairson 6 howev ourversion is perhap simpler and more eleg it is alsoeasili extend to find the prime factor of all integbetween 2 and n in time proport to n cacmdecemb 1978 gri d misra j prime algorithm data structur5 25 5 24 5 29 ca781202 dh januari 221979 11 12 am 2896 4 3037 2972 4 30373037 4 3037 3037 4 3037 3039 4 3037 30434 3037 3073 4 3037 2732 5 3037 2927 53037 3037 5 3037 3037 5 3037 3037 5 3037
