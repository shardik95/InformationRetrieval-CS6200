compress tri thi paper present a new data structur calla compress trie or c trie to be us ininform retriev system it ha the same underli m aritree structur as a trie where m is a parametof the trie but wherea the field of the nodein a trie have to be larg enough to holda kei or at least a pointer the field ina c trie ar onli on bit long in theanalysi part of the paper it will be shown thatfor a collect of n kei the retriev time measurin term of bit inspect of on kei is ofthe order logm n and the storag requir of theorder n m log2 n bit thi improv in storagrequir and retriev time is achiev at the cost ofdecreas the flexibl of the structur and therefor updat costar increas first the c trie is analyz as adata structur and then sever method of it us forrel static databas ar discuss cacm juli 1976 mali kdata structur databas m ari tree trie retriev time storagrequir kei 3 70 3 74 3 75 ca760707 jbjanuari 4 1978 12 26 pm 2846 4 2846 8494 2846 944 4 2846 155 5 2846 2846 52846 2846 5 2846 2846 5 2846 3041 5 28462846 6 2846 2905 6 2846
