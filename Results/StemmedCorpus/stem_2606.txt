a new integr algorithm for ordinari differenti equat base oncontinu fraction approxim a new integr algorithm is found andan implement is compar with other program algorithm the newalgorithm is a step by step procedur for solv theiniti valu problem in ordinari differenti equat it is designto approxim pole of small integ order in the solutof the differenti equat by continu fraction obtain by manipulthe sum of truncat taylor seri expans the new methodis compar with gragg bulirsh stoer and the taylor serimethod the taylor seri method and the new method arshown to be superior in speed and accuraci while thenew method is shown to be most superior when thesolut is requir near a singular the new method canfinal be seen to pass automat through singular where allthe other method which ar discuss will have fail cacmseptemb 1974 willer i m ordinari differenti equat initi valuproblem integr taylor seri singular continu fraction program comparison 517 ca740902 jb januari 17 1978 9 06 am 26065 2606 2606 5 2606 2606 5 2606
