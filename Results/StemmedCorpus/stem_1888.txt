spline function method for nonlinear boundari valu problem the solutof the nonlinear differenti equat y f x y ywith two point boundari condit is approxim by a quinticor cubic spline function y x the method is wellsuit to nonuniform mesh size and dynam mesh size allocfor uniform mesh size h the error in the quinticspline y x is o h 4 with typic erroron third that from numerov s method requir the differentiequat to be satisfi at the mesh point result ina set of differ equat which ar block tridiagon andso ar easili solv by relax or other standard methodcacm june 1969 blue j l boundari valu problem differentiequat finit differ function approxim iter method nonlinear equat splinefunction 5 13 5 15 5 17 ca690605 jb februari17 1978 11 07 am 1888 5 1888 1888 51888 1888 5 1888
